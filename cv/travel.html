<h2>Speaking & Travel</h2>
<br />

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: During my Spencer Education Fellowship (that is, during the 2017-2018 academic year), I will not accept any speaking engagements that require travel.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Ohio State University Archives, March 2018</li>
	<li>ASU-GSV Summit, April 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>New York City speaking engagements:</p>

<ul>
<li>CUNY Graduate Center, April 26</li>
</ul>
