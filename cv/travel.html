<h2>Speaking & Travel</h2>
<br />

<p><strong>Please note</strong>: During my Spencer Education Fellowship (that is, during the 2017-2018 academic year), I will not accept any speaking engagements that require travel. (For more information on how to hire me to speak, <a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv/speaking">please read these guidelines</a>.)</p>

<p>I will be traveling to the following for research:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Harvard University, June 2018</li>
	<li>Stanford University, June 2018</li>
</ul>
