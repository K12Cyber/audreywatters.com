<h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
<p><a href="../../cv.html">HTML</a>, <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/CV">GitHub</a></p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I write. I've always written.</p>
<p>These days, I write primarily about education technologies on my site&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>. I'm also the editor and lead writer for a new site, <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a>. My work has also appeared in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/audrey-watters/">The Atlantic</a>, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Radar</a>, <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">KQED's MindShift</a>, <a href="http://insidehighered.com/">Inside Higher Ed</a>, <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/author/awatters/">School Library Journal</a>, <a href="http://readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Home.aspx">Campus Technology</a>, <a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://edutopia.org/">Edutopia</a>, and elsewhere across the Web.&nbsp;I've been a blogger on-and-off for the past ten years, blending the personal, the political, and the professional as I've written about school, learning, life, and death. Before that, I wrote <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fYilhFkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">academic essays</a> -- some published, some not. (Few read.) Before that, poetry.</p>
<p>I'm the author of <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em>, a collection of my lectures. I'm working on a book, <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em>, that's due out in 2015.</p>
<h2>Speaking</h2>
<p>Freelance writing isn't terribly lucrative. Go figure. So to pay the bills, I speak. My last five engagements have been at the University of Mary Washington, OpenCon, Digital Labor 2014, New York University, and Pepperdine University. (My upcoming travel/speaking schedule is posted to the right.)</p>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I left the classroom circa 2007.&nbsp;I miss teaching.&nbsp;The closest thing I've done lately is work on an&nbsp;<a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com">Ed-Tech Guide</a>,&nbsp;and I keep threatening to turn this into a "course" and not just "course content."&nbsp;I've facilitated workshops for&nbsp;<a href="http://hybridpedagogy2012.thatcamp.org/">THATCamp Hybrid Pedagogy</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://p2pu.org/en/groups/writing-for-the-web/">P2PU</a>&nbsp;on writing and publishing online, outside academia.&nbsp;So maybe...&nbsp;<em>maybe</em>... you can say I still teach writing.</p>
<p>As a graduate student at the University of Oregon, I taught classes in Folklore, Composition, English, Women's Studies, and Comparative Literature. Below are syllabi for a few of the courses I designed and taught, with links to PDFs and to GitHub repositories which you are free, of course, to download or fork.</p>
