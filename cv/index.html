<h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
<p><a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv/cv.html">HTML</a>, <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/CV">GitHub</a></p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I write. I've always written.</p>
<p>I write essays and analysis (and rants) about education technology on my site&nbsp;<a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.</p>
<p>I do freelance from time-to-time, and my work has appeared in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/audrey-watters/">The Atlantic</a>, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Radar</a>, <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/">KQED's MindShift</a>, <a href="http://insidehighered.com/">Inside Higher Ed</a>, <a href="http://www.thedigitalshift.com/author/awatters/">School Library Journal</a>, <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a>, <a href="http://readwriteweb.com/">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a href="http://campustechnology.com/Home.aspx">Campus Technology</a>, <a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://edutopia.org/">Edutopia</a>, and elsewhere across the Web.&nbsp;I've been a blogger on-and-off for the past ten years, blending the personal, the political, and the professional as I've written about school, learning, life, and death. Before that, I wrote <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fYilhFkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">academic essays</a> -- some published, some not. (Few read.) Before that, poetry.</p>
<p>I'm the author of <em><a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">The Monsters of Education Technology</a></em>, a collection of my lectures. I'm working on two books, <em><a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a></em> and <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>, both due out in 2015.</p>
<h2>Speaking</h2>
<p>Freelance writing isn't terribly lucrative. Go figure. So to pay the bills, I speak. Or, I write lengthy essays, and then I read them out loud to an audience. You can read the transcripts <a href="http://speaking.hackeducation.com">here</a>. My upcoming travel and speaking schedule is available <a href="audreywatters.com/cv/travel.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>I officially left the classroom (circa 2007) when I left graduate school. I've taught a handful of classes and workshops since.<p>
<p>As a grad student at the University of Oregon, I taught classes in Folklore, Composition, English, Women's Studies, and Comparative Literature. Below are syllabi for a few of the courses I designed and taught, with links to PDFs and to GitHub repositories which you are free, of course, to download or fork.</p>
