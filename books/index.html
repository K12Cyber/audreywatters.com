Do teaching machines offer &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; or merely a more efficient standardization? This is the story of the development of education technology in the 20th century. Why have we been so keen for so long to automate teaching and learning? What does this say about our vision of the purpose, let alone the future of education?</p>
