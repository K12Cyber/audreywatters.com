<p><strong>THE MONSTERS OF EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY</strong> (2014)</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/frankenstein.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" align="right" />I spent much of 2014 on the road, traveling and speaking extensively about education technology&rsquo;s histories, ideologies, and mythologies. <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> is a collection of fourteen of those talks on topics ranging from teaching machines to convivial tools, from ed-tech mansplaining to information justice.</p>

<p><strong>RECLAIM YOUR DOMAIN</strong> (Coming Soon)</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/house150.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" align="right" />Too often, education technologies are developed that position students as objects of education, a reflection no doubt of how traditional educational practices also view students. These technologies do things <em>to</em> students, rather than foster student agency. If we are to challenge what "school" should look like, we must also challenge what "ed-tech" does as well. What sorts of technologies can and should we build to give students more control? What sorts of technologies can offer students the power to "own" their learning -- their data, their content, their digital profiles, and their domain?</p>

<p><strong>TEACHING MACHINES</strong> (Coming Soon)</p>
<p><img style="margin: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/teachermachines.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" align="right" /><em>Teaching Machines</em> explores the drive to automate education, not simply as a technological or scientific or pedagogical development, but as a profoundly cultural one. How have we conceptualized the mechanics of human intelligence, for example, and how has that shaped the way in which we imagine and build so-called intelligent machines? How do teaching machines work? <em>Do</em> teaching machines work? And whose work, whose labor, might they replace or enhance? Do teaching machines offer &ldquo;personalization&rdquo; or merely a more efficient standardization? This is the story of the development of education technology in the 20th century. Why have we been so keen for so long to automate teaching and learning? What does this say about our vision of the purpose, let alone the future of education?</p>
