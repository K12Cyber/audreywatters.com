<h3>Full Disclosure...</h3>
</br />

<p>I am always suspicious when I hear people invoke &#8220;objectivity&#8221; &#8211; whether they&#8217;re scientists or journalists or teachers. I am deeply implicated &#8211; me, Audrey &#8211; in all I write, in all I think. I try my best to be transparent about that. So here&#8217;s some things that situate my knowledge (and for you, dear reader, to situate me in turn):</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<br />
<p>I went to public school in Wyoming through 11th grade when I attended a <a href="http://www.stclares.ac.uk/">private boarding school</a> in Oxford, England. (My dad&#8217;s from Wyoming; my mum&#8217;s from England.) I did not graduate from high school. (The State of Wyoming would not grant me my diploma as I didn&#8217;t have enough PE credits.) I have an International Baccalaureate instead. The IB was the best education I received in my entire educational career: from kindergarten through graduate school. I recognize the privilege of private school.</p>

<p>I dropped out of college when I was 19. I had a baby when I was 21. I went back to school eventually (mostly taking undergraduate classes via &#8220;distance education&#8221;) and stayed there for multiple degrees. I was widowed when I was 34. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/08/29/the-real-reason-i-dropped-out-of-a-phd-program/">I dropped out of a PhD program a year later</a></a>.</p>

<p>I taught university for almost 10 years, teaching a variety of classes in a number of departments: composition, Folklore, Women&#8217;s Studies, English, Film, Comparative Literature. During that time, I was a member of the <a href="http://gtff.net/">Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation</a>, the labor union representing the University of Oregon graduate students and a local of the American Federation of Teachers. I am no longer a member of either union, as I&#8217;m no longer a grad student.</p>

<p>I wrote my Masters Thesis in Folklore on political pranks. It included a chapter on political pie-throwing, and at one time I was known as the scholarly expert on this act.</p>

<p>I worked for the <a href="http://iste.org/">International Society for Technology in Education</a> (ISTE) for (not quite) two years before resigning to become a freelance writer. I have no financial interest in the organization and am not a member.</p>

<p>I have a 24-year-old son who&#8217;s opted not to finish college. I don&#8217;t believe that everyone should have to go to college; I think that times are incredibly tough for those who don&#8217;t. (That&#8217;s not a new thing; that&#8217;s sorta always been the point, right?)</p>

<h3>Economics</h3>
<br />
<p>I have freelanced for various education-related publications, including The Baffler, The Atlantic, Educating Modern Learners, KQED&#8217;s MindShift, Inside Higher Ed, and The School Library Journal.</p>

<p>Mostly I write for my own ed-tech blog <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>. I refuse to run ads or take sponsorship dollars. Instead, the site is funded <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/support/">by readers&#8217; donations</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also done some <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com">research</a> to pay my bills. I tend to do quite a bit of <a href="http://speaking.hackeducation.com">speaking</a>, which is mostly how I pay the bills. I don&#8217;t do consulting. <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2014/12/21/frequently-asked-questions">So don&#8217;t ask</a>.</p>

<p>I currently sit on the advisory board of the Digital Pedagogy Lab, but there is no financial remuneration for that work.</p>

<p>I am a recipient of the Spencer Education Journalism Fellowship for the 2017&#8211;2018 academic year. I was a recipient of a Shuttleworth Foundation Flash Grant in 2014.</p>

<p>When my dad died a few years ago, I inherited enough money to pay off my student loans. I also inherited a stake in some empty commercial lots in Casper, Wyoming that I should probably sell before it&#8217;s time to pay property taxes on that crap again. I do not have any other investments, and I do not own any stocks in any companies.</p>

<p>My partner <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> is also a technology professional, and we&#8217;ve started a business (and <a href="http://podcast.contrafabulists.com">a podcast</a>) together called <a href="http://contrafabulists.com">Contrafabulists</a>. As the name perhaps suggests, we are interested in giving the stories told by the tech industry some well-deserved critical scrutiny. </p>

<p>When people ask where Kin and I live, I have often said &#8220;out of a suitcase.&#8221; I should add, when traveling, &#8220;hopefully near free WiFi and a power source.&#8221; Currently my suitcases are stored in a cupboard in our apartment in NYC, which thankfully seems to have decent Internet connectivity.</p>
