<p>The template that I use to write this &#8220;week in review&#8221; makes a lot of sense when the week is &#8220;normal.&#8221; But even when it&#8217;s not normal &#8211; when my time is spent doing something other than writing, researching, and speaking, when my mind and my body are elsewhere &#8211; I can still make it appear as though it&#8217;s all business-as-usual. It&#8217;s a performance of transparency that easily hides more than it reveals (something that should always give us pause about those who tout transparency and &#8220;openness&#8221; without really scrutinizing how these gestures can be so easily manipulated). </p>

<p>There are lots of reasons I write this weekly post &#8211; mostly I do it to help keep track of what I&#8217;ve worked on, something that helps in turn when it&#8217;s time to update my CV or write my year-end reviews or find a link to an article I&#8217;ve written or appeared in. It keeps friends and family informed of what I&#8217;m up to. (A special shout-out here to those who pour through my online life, looking for reasons to condemn, mock, dismiss, harass, sue me.)</p>

<p>Things weren&#8217;t &#8220;normal&#8221; this week. They haven&#8217;t been &#8220;normal&#8221; for a while now, to be honest. But this week&#8217;s abnormalities felt unusually out-of-sorts. Things are shifting. But as Al Swearengen once said, &#8220;Everything changes. Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;</p>
