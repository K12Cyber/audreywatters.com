<p>I love pickled ginger. I mean I <em>love</em> it. When I eat sushi, I shove the whole little pile of it in my mouth all at once before eyeing my dining companions&#8217; plates to see if they want theirs. I try to always keep some in my refrigerator and eat it after meal. Oh sure, I justify snacking on the vinegary slices by insisting it serves as some sort of dietary aid. But mostly I love the sharp flavor.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a vendor at the local farmers&#8217; market that makes a pretty good version. The ingredients read: ginger, red pepper flakes, and apple cider. I love the inclusion of the red pepper flakes as it increases that spicy burn; I love the exclusion of sugar as I don&#8217;t eat pickled ginger for its sweetness. I&#8217;m fascinated that the label says <em>apple cider</em> and not <em>apple cider vinegar</em> &#8211; all the recipes I&#8217;ve ever read have called for vinegar so I don&#8217;t know if the cider is fermented along with the ginger or what.</p>

<p>I remember this pickled ginger being much more delicious when I lived here before. Now that I&#8217;m back from New York, where I would purchase pickled ginger in vast quantities from the deli counter at H Mart, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m as happy with this SoCal version as I was before. The ginger seems stringier. The taste isn&#8217;t as sharp as I recall.</p>

<p>The H Mart pickled ginger was crisper and perhaps fresher. (I tried both the white and the pink from H Mart, and I think that the latter was dyed rather than made with younger ginger.) The H Mart pickled ginger was less sweet than what you find a lot of places &#8211; a plus, in my book &#8211; although there was some chemical aftertaste to it that I couldn&#8217;t place. (The ingredients were all in Korean.) The little plastic cartons, sitting in the sushi section, often stunk like fish.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m going to try my hand at pickling my own ginger, so that I can dial in the right level of sweet and spice. There&#8217;s a little joke in that phrase &#8220;try my hand&#8221; as I bought a mandolin slicer. Hopefully all my fingers will remain intact. </p>

<p>Here are the ingredients for my first experiment:</p>

<ul>
	<li>8 oz fresh ginger</li>
	<li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

<p>I peeled the ginger, sliced it, and put the pieces in a half-pint mason jar. I sprinkled the red pepper flakes on top. In a saucepan, I brought the vinegar, sugar, and salt to a simmer, stirring until the sugar was dissolved. I then poured the liquid over the ginger and secured the lids. This isn&#8217;t a &#8220;proper&#8221; can, so once cooled, I put in the fridge. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a little bit of pickled ginger left from the farmers&#8217; market, and I&#8217;m heading out of town soon. But I&#8217;ll probably crack this jar open fairly soon and think about what needs to be changed. (I&#8217;m also heading out of town for a week, so I want to taste it before and after to see what difference sitting in the sugar-vinegar makes to the flavor and consistency.)</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more attempts at this&#8230;</p>
