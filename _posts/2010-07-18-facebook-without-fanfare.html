I was sick of all the privacy bullshit.  There was no big fanfare, just a couple of blog posts.  I deactivated my account, and I was done.  <p></p>
At one point, it's fair to say, Facebook played a big part in how I spent my time online.  But once I stepped away from Facebook, I really didn't miss it.  Friends still email me.  Friends still call.  I chat with folks via Twitter, via Skype.  I read blog posts.  I see folks at the bar.  My online life stayed social, despite Facebook's insinuations that people would be unable to keep in touch with me without it.  (<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_happens_when_you_deactivate_your_facebook_acc.php">ZOMG</a>)  <p></p>
I'm not too sure why I decided to return to Facebook.  I guess it makes sense professionally that I pay attention to changes to the site.  I guess.  And so, blah, with even less fanfare than my departure, I reactivated my account at the beginning of the month.  <p></p>
Since then, I've returned to Facebook only a handful of times.  The site holds little appeal, even though I realize it's the best way to reach a lot of old friends and family.  I tried running my Facebook news feed through Tweetdeck, so that I could at least keep track of what folks were saying.  But there were errors, and issues, and such.  <p></p>
I don't push any of my social streams into Facebook, even though I could (and maybe should).  That would be rude though, as I'm not listening to what's being said there. <p></p>
I should find a way to reintegrate Facebook into my life, but I just can't make myself click that "connect" or "like" button.
