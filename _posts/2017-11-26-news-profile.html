<p>Alexander Russo of The Grade sent me a list of questions &#8211; a follow-up to some comments I&#8217;d made in one of my newsletters about the problems with journalism and (ed-)tech trade publications. His description of my work is a bit odd. I have &#8220;tunnel vision&#8221; he contends, and do not give any context to developments in education technology. &#8220;I am uncomfortable with her single-minded focus on education technology and its potential dangers and downsides,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s called &#8220;a beat&#8221;? But as he notes. I am not a &#8220;traditional journalist&#8221;</p>
