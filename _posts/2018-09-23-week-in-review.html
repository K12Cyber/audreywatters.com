<li>Research. The usual&#8230; (Actually, not really &#8220;the usual&#8221; &#8211; I am on the cusp of a big breakthrough on the book, I feel. Perhaps reading so much David and Douglas Noble that week is doing that to me)</li>

<h3>Other Projects <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_project.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve been cooking and baking quite a bit this week (including steak japchae, picture above although that is not my photo). It feels good to get back in the habit of doing so, and eating out less (I might start a subsection here in this weekly roundup to write about what I made)</li>
<li>I did some invoicing, realizing that I have a couple of articles in total limbo right now (but not necessarily having the energy to chase down why)</li>
<li>I talked to Ben Herold about Jeff Bezos and Ben Riley about the current state of edu (it&#8217;s always good to chat with both these two)</li>
<li>I had to fix a problem with subdomains here and on hackeducation.com &#8211; someone was using them to host pirated PDFs. Fun times. (Not fun times)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_bookmark.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I read <em>The Classroom Arsenal</em> and <em>IBM&#8217;s Early Computers</em>, and I&#8217;ve started reading <em>America By Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism</em></li>
<li>I binge-watched <em>The Good Plac</em>e and the latest season of <em>Luke Cage</em></li>
</ul>
