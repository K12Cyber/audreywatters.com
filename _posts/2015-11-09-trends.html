<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2015-2">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>In a few weeks, I'll start my annual look back at the year in ed-tech. I still haven't narrowed down the "top trends" to just ten. Nor have I started the process of pouring back through each's week's news round-up that I write. But as it stands, here's my running list (some of which can obviously be consolidated, changed, expanded):</p>
<ol>
<li>The Business of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>The Politics of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>Privacy, Data, and Algorithms</li>
<li>Outsourcing and Privatization</li>
<li>Free College?</li>
<li>The Collapse of For-Profit Higher Ed (Or Not)</li>
<li>Online Education (the Hype formerly Known as &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo;)</li>
<li>The Common Core State Standards</li>
<li>Opt-Out and Testing</li>
<li>Competency-Based Education</li>
<li>School as Skills Training - &ldquo;The Employability Narrative&rdquo;</li>
<li>Annotation (and the Indie Web)</li>
<li>Free Speech and Social Media</li>
</ol>
