I won't lie.  I'm still stuck on playing <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1158">World of Goo</a>.  I've got several video game reviews I'm trying to write this weekend (I know.  Rough life.)  And yet, I keep returning to World of Goo instead of moving along in my other game-related writing projects.  <p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201006penumbra.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201006penumbra.jpg" alt="" title="penumbra" width="250" height="202" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1164" /></a>I say that, because I fear I'm going to write a review now about Frictional Games' <a href="http://www.penumbragame.com/ageGate.php">Penumbra Overture</a> that is impatient and dissatisfied. <p></p>
It's been a while since I've played a first-person action/puzzle game like Penumbra Overture, I'll admit.  Despite all my brother's encouragement, I never really got into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a>, and so it may very well be since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Zork">Return to Zork</a> that I've been really immersed in a game that involved wandering around with that sort of must-click-on-everything-must-talk-to-everyone problem-solving gameplay.  Oh gawd, I loved Zork.  But that was 1993ish, and my standards for engaging gameplay have changed some. <p></p>
Penumbra Overture begins with an opening sequence about your dead mother and a mysterious note from your long-presumed-dead father who'd abandoned you as an infant.  And then suddenly you're in Greenland.  To protect yourself from a blizzard, you enter a mine.  And, um, that's as far as I got.   <p></p>
You can manipulate key pieces of your surroundings -- pick up, move, break things.  I found a flashlight.  A flare.  A hammer.  I broke through a wall.  But then I got bored.<p></p>
Oh and irritatingly, it seems as though there's no easy way to save (but as it was open-sourced as part of the Humble Indie Bundle, I should figure out how to do that myself rather than just gripe about it). <p></p>
There's a lot more to this game, and I didn't even experience combat.  So really, what the hell sort of review is this anyway.  Let me point you to a "real" review <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/penumbra/review.html">here</a> which says that the game can be beaten in about six or seven hours.<p></p>
But don't mind me while I spend the next six or seven hours playing World of Goo instead.
