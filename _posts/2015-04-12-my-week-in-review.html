<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Nope. I did arrange accommodations in Berlin and Barcelona; and I realize I need to deal with ISTE planning too. Ugh.</li>
<li>Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I gave a talk (virtually) at Western Oregon University on education technology and (the lack of) social justice. The transcript is above.</li>
<li>My interview with Rod Berger was published in EdCircuit: &#8220;<a href="http://www.edcircuit.com/audrey-watters-dissects-edtech-investment-wave-for-school-administrators/">Audrey Watters Dissects EdTech Investment Wave for School Administrators</a>.&#8221;</li>
<li>I added a new subdomain to Hack Education, <a href="http://sf.hackeducation.com">sf.hackeducation.com</a>, where I&#8217;m building a list of literature and films that address education in the future. It&#8217;s mostly, but not entirely, science fiction.</li>
<li>I was included in last weekend&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/features/sunday-reading-105">Sunday Reading</a>.&#8221; (It doesn&#8217;t happen that often, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve bragged about it in the past; but I&#8217;m always stoked when my writing shows up here.)</li>
<li>I added SSL on Hack Education and audreywatters.com.</li>
<li>I worked on an article for Educating Modern Learners, to be published Monday.</li>
<li>I got a very <a href="http://blog.benwildeboer.com/2015/book-review-the-monsters-of-education-technology/">nice book review</a> of <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> from Ben Wildeboer.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve made it to the gym every day this month. And I&#8217;m still on the wagon too. 11 days of sobriety!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing and Listening</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Like many Americans this week, we got HBO and have been binge-watching old series and documentaries. We watched <em>True Detective</em>, for example, and <em>Going Clear</em>.</li>
<li>We also bought the digital versions of Episodes 4, 5, and 6 of <em>Star Wars</em>, but I dunno&#8230; the revisions that George Lucas made make me so angry, I can hardly bear to watch.</li>
<li>I bought the new Mountain Goats album.</li>
<li>I finished <em>The Patchworth Girl of Oz</em> and started <em>Tik-Tok of Oz</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>The kid is here visiting for a few days. He&#8217;s still trying to figure out what he&#8217;s going to do with his life, but he seems in fairly good form, so I&#8217;m not going to fret too too much.</li>
</ul>
