<blockquote>
<p>"To a student of educational radio, prowling through yellowed scripts, it seems almost incredible that teachers who presumably hoped to reach men&rsquo;s minds elected to attempt it with anesthetics. Surely, secrets of audience psychology readily mastered by semi-literate movie stars and dance-band leaders are not hidden from the academicians."</p>
