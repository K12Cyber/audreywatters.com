<p>I am making more progress on the book draft. The exciting update this week, I suppose, is that I received a copy of (some of) B. F. Skinner&#8217;s FBI file. He talks about this in his autobiography &#8211; the fact that the FBI could not account for his whereabouts for a year-and-a-half after he graduated college. Suspicious! The file also contained materials relating to correspondence he received from &#8220;Red China.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t contain anything that is new or startling &#8211; but I will try to find a way to talk about the ways in which the &#8220;Red Scare&#8221; shaped ed-tech in the post-war era.</p>

<p>The apartment is almost entirely &#8220;set up.&#8221; I received an IKEA delivery on Friday and spent all that day assembling bookshelves and the like. I tried to put together the sofa bed for the office yesterday, but I needed Kin here to help. He was in Hermosa Beach, finishing up emptying our apartment there. The transition is almost complete, and we&#8217;re so close to closing the SoCal chapter of our lives &#8211; for now at least.</p>

<p>I watched <em>Finding Neverland</em>, which pretty much ruined my week.</p>
