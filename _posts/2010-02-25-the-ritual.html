<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201002guitar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-127" title="guitar" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201002guitar.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a>Since I started this blog, I've managed to write a little and hit the ol' "publish" button daily. It's important for me to do so. I need to spend more time writing. I have so many things I want to write about; the running list of potential topics I keep is lengthy. But even with plenty of ideas already generated, the act of putting pen to paper (fingers to keyboard) tonight seems almost beyond me. I'm tired, sure. It's Thursday after all. But my mind is racing, and it seems unlikely I'll be able to slow it down enough to write anything coherent.
<p style="text-align: left;">Even practicing the guitar is tough tonight. G - D - G - D - G - D. Then G - C - G - C - G - C. Much like the ritual of writing, I work to develop the muscle memory for guitar. But distracted, I google the chords for "Where the Moss Slowly Grows," a song even more out of my reach than the opening bars of "Wanted Dead or Alive" -- which I absolutely plan to learn. A - G - F. Goddamn bar chords. So I put the guitar away, and just put Tiger Army on repeat, and pretend like working through all the thoughts this song conjures -- C - G - F / "Don't miss this chance, it may not come again" -- will get me somewhere that practicing writing/guitar can't tonight.<p></p>
