<div id="_mcePaste">A former co-worker, Katrina, has <a href="http://katinthekitch.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">an amazing baking blog</a>. Unlike me, she can take great pictures <strong>and </strong>follow a recipe. Despite the fact that she too cusses like a sailor, you can follow her culinary tips and tricks and probably come out with some <a href="http://katinthekitch.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/in-the-red-2/" target="_blank">kick-ass red velvet cupcakes</a> at the end of the day. (I cannot attest to this, but I am going to try this weekend. I may or may not blog about it.)
<p>But me? I dunno. This is how it'd go if I were to have a cooking blog.</p>
<div id="_mcePaste"><strong>Tonight's dinner: enchiladas.</strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Swing by the grocery store on the way home from work and get more corn tortillas. There are some in the fridge but I can't recall how long it's been since I last made enchiladas, so they could be stale. And/or there might not be enough.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><strong>Step 2: </strong>Get home. Open beer. Chug.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Step 3: </strong>Put pinto beans in pressure cooker. Yes, like any former hippie, I keep a stockpile of dried beans. Wanna make something of it? Cook beans.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><strong>Step 4: </strong> Cook rice. Do I need to say more about this? I mean, water -- boil. Rice -- cook.  <strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Step 5: </strong>Make sauce. I'd include the recipe, because I get all sorts of praise for my enchiladas. But it's not really a recipe per se. Take an onion and chop it. Saute it in some oil. Add some flour to make a paste. Add a lot of chili powder. ("A lot" -- um, several tablespoons?). Add some cumin. ("Some" -- um, like, a heaping teaspoon?). Salt -- you decide. Garlic. Add liquid (water, chicken stock, you know the routine) and cook til thickened-ish. Taste along the way, adjusting spices. Lament the lack of time to allow sauce to simmer and flavors steep.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><strong>Step 6: </strong>Think to oneself, "Hmm, this seems bland." Browse cupboards. Find a can of diced green chiles. Note, with relief, that the expiration date has not yet passed. Add green chilis to beans and rice mixture.  <strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Step 7: </strong> Rummage through fridge. Find leftover corn tortillas. Curse the extra stop at the grocery store and the fact that, once again, you'll have more corn tortillas than one batch of enchiladas requires. Search for expiration date on tortillas. Test their softness. Decide they'll be fine when covered in spicy sauce. Soften corn tortillas on hot skillet. Wonder why playing the guitar hurts so badly since clearly years of making enchiladas have resulted in burning off most feeling from my fingertips. Fold up burning hot beans and rice in a burning hot corn tortilla. Repeat.</div>
<div></div>
<div id="_mcePaste"><strong>Step 8: </strong>Cover with sauce. Locate just enough cheddar in the fridge to cover the top.  <strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Step 9: </strong> Bake at 400 til Isaiah cannot wait any longer for dinner. (We made it 20 minutes tonight) Serve with salsa and sour cream. Open 2nd beer.</div>
<div></div>
<strong>Step 10: </strong> Get feedback from Isaiah: "Next time, please add meat." Leave the kitchen a mess for tomorrow. Take picture of dirty plate with iPhone. Blog.
