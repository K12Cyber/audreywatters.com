I'm getting better at this whole <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/07/16/tech-blogger-on-the-road/">tech-blogging-on-the-road</a> thing, which is great as I'm off to <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010">OSCON</a> this week and will once again have to balance Internet, power, and prose.  But before I get too far ahead of myself and gush over the promise of open source technology, let me gush over my past week.<p></p>
I was pretty pleased with my writing this week, and I had several successful posts over at ReadWriteWeb, including the very popular <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/07/ten-inspiring-ted-talks-for-st.php">10 Inspiring TED Talks for Startups</a>.<p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201007creativity.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201007creativity.jpg" alt="" title="creativity" width="350" height="297" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1344" /></a>My favorite RWW story, curation of TED talks aside, was the one inspired by Newsweek's contention that we're in the midst of a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/07/technology-the-american-creati.php">Creativity Crisis</a>, with technology and teachers apparently to blame.  It was my favorite story because I think it gets to the core of what I want to do with my tech-blogging:  find ways to help encourage smart, creative kids with smart, creative ed-tech supported by smart, creative teachers and parents.<p></p>
Despite a productive week of writing, there is always a long list of things I didn't get around to writing about.  And this week's list is even longer than the set of links I post on <a href="http://audreywatters.posterous.com/must-seehearread-from-the-week-of-july-11-201">Posterous</a>.  In my quest to be a better tech-blogger, however, I've sent out a slew of emails so that I can hopefully, ya know, interview folks before writing up new stories.<p></p>
