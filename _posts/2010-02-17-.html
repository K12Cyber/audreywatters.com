This website, for one, has become a good focal point for me, allowing me to go through old <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?page_id=105" target="_blank">essays</a> and <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?page_id=136" target="_blank">syllabi</a>, to revisit old ideas and move them forward or let them go as the case may be. I've barely scratched the surface with uploading those files.<p></p>

Yesterday, I started a new project, also associated with this website. One of the volunteers I work with at ISTE sent me an email with a bunch of great links to digital humanities projects, including information about an open-source archiving tool: <a href="http://omeka.org/" target="_blank">Omeka</a>. After some PHP upgrading on the server [insert geek talk here?], I now have the software installed, and I plan to start playing around with it. My first project will be to archive my 'zine collection -- just to get a feel for the tool, but also to have a project that I can showcase elsewhere (potential clients, schools, etc).<p></p>
Oh, and I found a guitar teacher.
