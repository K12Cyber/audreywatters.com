It was my first <a href="http://www.digg.com">Digg</a> front page, and best of all, it was on the subject of education technology:  "<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/4_tools_for_teaching_kids_to_code.php">4 Tools for Teaching Kids to Code</a>."<p></p>
I also had a great talk with NorthScale this week and wrote a post about <a href="http://www.membase.com">Membase</a>, the NoSQL database that NorthScale sponsors and that powers Farmville.  I reckon it was the Farmville, not the NoSQL, that generated the clickthroughs.  But hey!  I'm getting better at explaining RDBMS-NoSQL-WTFBBQ.  I think.<p></p>
I'm in the middle of a back-to-school series for RWW, which I'm very excited to be writing (as I get to talk to a bunch of educators, edtech, and tech folks).  Subsequently, I've received some really kind words from fellow educator-bloggers:  Julie Meloni called RWW her favorite blog and me "her most favorite RWW author" in <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Reader-Poll-Tech-Tool-Youre/26127/">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a> - a huge honor as she has always been an inspiration for me to tackle tech.  And Richard Byrne from Free Technology for Teachers said of my edtech blog <a href="http://www.freetech4teachers.com/2010/08/hack-education-add-this-blog-to-your.html">Hack Education - Add This Blog to Your RSS Reader</a>."  <p></p>
I am writing a lot at <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>, in case you haven't followed Mr. Byrne's command and started reading me there.  <p></p>
In other news, I turned 39 this week.  There was a great story to being 38.  I'll tell you it all some time.<p></p>
