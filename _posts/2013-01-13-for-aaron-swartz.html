<p>I wept yesterday. I wept <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html">over the loss of a young man</a> I never knew. I wept for his friends and his family. I wept <a href="http://www.quinnnorton.com/said/?p=644">for Quinn</a>. <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">For Larry</a>. <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">For Cory</a>. I wept for the open Web &mdash; for the work done and left undone.</p>
<p>I wept for all of us.</p>
<hr />
<p>I never met Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old Internet activist who took his life on Friday. But I use the technologies that he helped build every day: RSS, Creative Commons licensing, Markdown, Reddit, HTTPS Everywhere.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t simply that I rely on these technologies as I work &mdash; I use these technologies to write and <em>to share my work openly and freely online</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was trained as a literary scholar and a folklorist. As such I&rsquo;m drawn to the study of cultures, tradition, upheaval, creativity, speech.</p>
<p>As such I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time pouring over academic journals &mdash; articles read, articles written.</p>
<p>As such I don&rsquo;t believe we can neatly separate form, content, and its distribution.</p>
<p>I left the academy. I&rsquo;m a technology writer now. As such I don&rsquo;t believe we can separate culture, technology, power, and politics, and I spend a lot of time thinking &mdash; particularly now that I write about education from outside education&rsquo;s institutions &mdash; about how all of this affects both knowledge production and knowledge control.</p>
<hr />
<p>The government persecuted &mdash; <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">prosecuted/persecuted</a> &mdash; Aaron Swartz for <a href="http://readwrite.com/2011/07/19/internet_activist_aaron_swartz_indicted_for_data_t">downloading academic journal articles</a> from the JSTOR archives.</p>
<p>Aaron Swartz took his own life two years to the day after his arrest.</p>
<p>He was facing multiple felony charges and some 30 years in prison for this hack, this &ldquo;<a href="http://unhandled.com/2013/01/12/the-truth-about-aaron-swartzs-crime/">crime</a>&rdquo; &mdash; for &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; when in fact, all the journal articles were still available via JSTOR; when in fact, Swartz had returned the data he&rsquo;d downloaded; when in fact JSTOR had no interest in pursuing the case.</p>
<p>And yet the government hounded him. Hounded him. Hounded him. Hounded him. Hounded him. Hounded him. Hounded him. A young man who never sought to make money from any of his technological genius, who has always hacked for the greater public good.</p>
<p>To echo, Larry Lessig: <a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">Shame</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I (try to) write for the greater public good. I believe so very fiercly in the principles of freedom: free speech, free access, free association. I believe and I write and I agitate and I fight. And it&rsquo;s hard &mdash; it&rsquo;s hard emotionally and spiritually. It's tricky financially and ethically. So hard. So tricky. So important.</p>
<p>And so I rage and I cry a lot.</p>
<hr />
<p>Aaron Swartz took his life.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d long suffered, as friends and family point out, from depression.</p>
<p>I think many of us do. Indeed I&rsquo;ve often wondered &mdash; having spent so much time studying activism, being an activist myself &mdash; what the mental health profile looks like for those of us who move in radical circles.</p>
<p>It feels like we&rsquo;re an &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; population, not just legally but emotionally &mdash; and it feels too as though the government leverages this to its own sick sick ends.</p>
<p>(Of course it does.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I scribbled a tear-stained note yesterday as I thought of all we&rsquo;ve lost: &ldquo;Revolutionaries burn at a heat that is often not sustainable for the human heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We fight because we care fiercly, deeply. It hurts us to do so. It would hurt us more to do otherwise.</p>
<hr />
<p>I scribbled: &ldquo;Despair. Despair. Despair. Despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even before hearing about Aaron Swartz's suicide, <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/01/11/hack-education-weekly-news-1-11-2013/">this past week</a> had already weighed heavily on me as I watched the dark cloud of various education/technology machinations &mdash; <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/education-of-michelle-rhee/">the Michelle Rhee documentary on PBS</a>; <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-08/national/36210252_1_teachers-math-classroom-observations">a Gates Foundation-backed study</a> claiming it knows what good teachers look like; <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/dnc/ci_22318811/gps-bus-passes-will-show-where-st-vrain">RFID tracking of students</a>; <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/01/08/rebooting-california-higher-education-storified/">a meeting at UCLA</a> of various university faculty, online education providers, politicians and power-brokers; <a href="http://www.cesweb.org/">CES</a>-related gadget fetishism, with bonus tech-blogger <a href="http://churnalism.com/">churnalism</a>; and the list goes on and on and on.</p>
<p>It depresses the hell out of me.</p>
<p>It spurs me on.</p>
<hr />
<p>More scribbles: &ldquo;depair. anger. frustration. helplessness. sadness. rage. rage. rage against the machine. the machine. the machine.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>Said Mario Savo:<em> &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can&rsquo;t take part. You can&rsquo;t even passively take part. And you&rsquo;ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels&hellip;upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you&rsquo;ve got to make it stop. And you&rsquo;ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you&rsquo;re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Who will stop the machine? Who will hack the machine?</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>We have lost our hero, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/01/remembering-aaron-swartz">our gift</a>, our Aaron Swartz. But we cannot give up our fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Aaron dead," <a href="https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/290140454211698689">tweeted Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the creator of the World Wide Web. "World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down. Parents all, we have lost a child. Let us weep."</p>
<p>And we weep.</p>
<p>And we fight.</p>
