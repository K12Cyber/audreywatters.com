What did I do?<p></p>
Slept in late.  Went to the gym, like, twice.  Drank a lot of beer.  Drank a lot of coffee.<p></p>
Had my boyfriend move in.<p></p>
Had to put the guitar aside. Swore that music would still stay a focus. Saw Deer Tick.<p></p>
Wrote sixteen blog posts for <a href="http://justmeans.com" target="_blank">Justmeans.com</a>.  Wrote thirty-five blog posts for <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com" target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a>.  Wrote two study guides for <a href="http://www.bookrags.com">BookRags</a>.  Participated in the "<a href="http://blog.simplek12.com/social-media/the-i-heart-edtech-blog-swap-mission-accomplished/" target="_blank">I Heart EdTech</a>" blog swap. Wrote a column for <em><a href="http://www.setp.net/" target="_blank">Special Education Technology Practice</a></em>.  Wrote on this blog.<p></p>
Read a gazillion RSS feeds.  Didn't watch a single goddamn movie. Read a book by André Breton. Started <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>. Started <em>The Art of the Start.</em><p></p>
Beat <em>Plants v Zombies</em>.<p></p>
Told my therapist I wasn't coming back.  Became another uninsured American.<p></p>
Tried to upload a poem on <a href="http://audreywatters.posterous.com" target="_blank">Posterous</a> every day for National Poetry Month.  (<a href="http://audreywatters.posterous.com/national-poetry-month-wrap-up-with-infographi" target="_blank">Failed</a>.)<p></p>
Had <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/">Doc Searls</a> comment on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/04/to-be-a-brand-or-not-to-be-a-brand.php" target="_blank">a blog post I wrote</a>, then <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2010/04/15/the-unbearable-lightness-of-branding/" target="_blank">write about it on his blog</a>, then <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=638" target="_blank">comment on this blog</a>. (Truly one the highlights of my month.) Had cool people like and link to my RWW posts.  Started getting "tips" emails.  Was spammed.  Had my first post syndicated on the <em>New York Times </em>website.  Had my second post there.<p></p>
Talked to some really cool people. Watched some cool events unfold. Watched some fucked up shit occur.<p></p>
Had tons of doors open.<p></p>
Is pretty goddamn content, but has plans, I tell you, plans for the month of May.
