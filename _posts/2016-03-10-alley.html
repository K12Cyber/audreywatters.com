<p>I live in HB. It&rsquo;s a small city &ndash; LA is made up of tons of these &ndash; with an area less than 1.5 square miles. One of its best features, I think, is The Strand, a paved path that runs for 22 miles along the beach from Pacific Palisades to Torrance. It&rsquo;s a bike path, ostensibly, but it&rsquo;s used by pedestrians too. Kin and I love it because we can amble along and talk and think and not have to worry about being hit by a car. (&ldquo;Being hit by a car&rdquo; is a big concern as a pedestrian in LA.)</p>
<p>Many of Hermosa Beach&rsquo;s streets are, in fact, alleys, including two right near my apartment building. This is where I walk. Unlike the majority (?) of those in LA, I don&rsquo;t own a car. I don&rsquo;t drive. I walk. I walk to the farmer&rsquo;s market, I walk to the post office, I walk to the restaurants, I walk to the bank, and so on. I choose to walk in the alley some days because it&rsquo;s a faster route. I choose the alley some days because I want to avoid the main thoroughfare &ndash; both its pedestrian and motor traffic. I choose the alley because it&rsquo;s interesting to walk along the back sides of buildings, to see the side that&rsquo;s not designed to be seen. No surprise for LA, the alley designed for cars and trucks &ndash; for parking, for deliveries, for sanitation. I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s a surprise for me when I nearly get mowed down by a vehicle, driving down an alley at top speed, treating it like a regular street.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I was walking down the alley today, I noticed that a restaurant around the corner from us has finally fenced in an open patch of land behind it. Before now, there was just a sign reminding dog owners to pick up after their dogs. It&rsquo;s a sign I can&rsquo;t un-see and can&rsquo;t stop thinking about: &ldquo;oh god, the back of this restaurant is full of shit and piss.&rdquo; Needless to say, I never eat there.</p>
<p>But as of today, they&rsquo;ve erected a fence; I guess it&rsquo;ll no longer be the place that the neighborhood&rsquo;s pet-owning apartment dwellers take their dogs. (The neighborhood cats are likely to be undeterred.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting choice: putting up a fence rather than, say, leveling and paving the area.</p>
<p>(I probably still won&rsquo;t eat at the restaurant.)</p>
<hr />
<p>We&rsquo;re steered down certain routes by design. We&rsquo;re steered away from others. The alley does not have a sidewalk. The message: I&rsquo;m not really supposed to walk there. Take the main street. That&rsquo;s where the entrances to the shops and restaurants are.</p>
<hr />
<p>As I walked down the alley this afternoon, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about technology &ndash; its infrastructure and its ideology. (I mean, that's what I do all day: think about technology &ndash; its infrastructure and its ideology.) There&rsquo;s a lot about the traffic and &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of technology that steers us down certain routes as well. We&rsquo;re pushed towards certain interfaces with certain interactions in mind.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;back end&rdquo; like the &ldquo;back alley&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t really designed for everyone. It isn't designed for "regular folks." And purposefully so.</p>
<p>Walk on the main street. Shop on the main street. Do not deviate.</p>
<p>Moreover, you&rsquo;re not really encouraged to ask about who owns the buildings or investigate the political connections of businesses leaders within a community. You&rsquo;re not supposed to notice the infrastructure at all.</p>
