<h2>Travel (and Speaking)</h2>
<p>Nope. I was supposed to travel to DC briefly, but that didn&rsquo;t pan out. It was a bit of a strange week, weather-wise &ndash; lots of Los Angeles rain. And it was an awful week, world-wise. Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach.</p>

<h2>The Monsters of Education Technology</h2>
<p>I self-published <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> on Monday. It&rsquo;s a collection of fourteen of the talks I delivered this year. (More details on how to download and/or buy are <a href="http://monsters.hackeducation.com">here</a>.) I also wrote about <a href="/2014/12/01/on-self-publishing-my-monsters/">the process of self-publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Jason Jones wrote <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/what-monsters-lurk-in-your-lms-audrey-watters-on-education-technology/58599">a very nice review</a> of the book for Prof Hacker. The good folks at Hybrid Pedagogy <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/page-two/convivial-tools-age-surveillance">republished a chapter</a> as well.</p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>A couple of follow-ups from my recent trip to the University of Mary Washington: D&rsquo;Arcy Norman has released part of the <a href="http://darcynorman.net/2014/12/01/reclaiming-educational-technology-the-business-and-politics-of-edtech/">documentary project</a> he worked on about the business and politics of ed-tech. And Jessica Reingold released her <a href="http://blogs.jessicareingold.com/infoage/projects-2/views-are-my-own/">documentary project</a> about digital identity. I have appearances in both.</p>
<h2>Family and Friends</h2>
<p>Kin&rsquo;s on the road again. This week we both finalized plans to have the kids come and visit for the holidays. And Darth made me a Santa avatar, so I&rsquo;m one of the Internet cool kids now.</p>
