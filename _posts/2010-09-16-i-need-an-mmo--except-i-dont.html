Perhaps 2 years since I played EQ2.  But lately, I've felt the urge to pick up an MMO again.  <p></p>
Sorry, but <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8">Angry Birds</a> just does not cut it.  I mean, don't get me wrong.  Angry Birds is fun.  Challenging.  I've spent a fair chunk of time stuck on a couple of levels, and I've barely made a dent in the game.  <p></p>
And there are a couple of other casual games I play regularly. <a href="http://echobazaar.failbettergames.com/">Echo Bazaar</a>, of course -- I am a loyal fan.<p></p>
But I miss MMOs.  I miss stabbing things (virtually).  I miss healing (virtually).  I miss yelling in vent (really).  I miss "epic."  I miss gaming.<p></p>
I supposed I could pick up WoW again, but I left the game with such a bitter taste in my mouth.  I'd rather play EQ2, a game for which I have fonder memories, but where are my disks?  What's my password?  And oh yeah, I'm on a Mac.  <p></p>
On a Mac, my choices are WoW, Second Life, City of Heroes, or EVE Online.  Blah.  And so maybe I'm not so enthusiastic for an MMO after all.<p></p>
And perhaps it's best I stick with the casual gaming.  My MMO days veered awfully close to "hardcore raider," and I just don't have time right now to devote to that world.  <p></p>
("To that insanity," I almost typed, although at this stage, I think my memories of playing MMOs have melded with episodes from <a href="http://watchtheguild.com">The Guild</a>.  "Screenshot or it didn't happen," folks say.  And I can't seem to find the folder where I stored all those memories.  So I don't know where the time went and which dragons I killed.  And honestly, I can't go back to that.)
