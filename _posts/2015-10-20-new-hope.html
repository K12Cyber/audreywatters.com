<p>In May 1999, i pulled my kid out of kindergarten early so we could see Star Wars Episode 1 on opening day. (his teacher was so pissed.)</p>
<p><em>I </em>was pissed; the movie was terrible. nonetheless i just bought tickets for opening day of Episode 7 for the kid and me.</p>

<p>To be honest, I've become more of a Star Trek person. That is, I prefer Gene Roddenberry's fantasy to George Lucas's. Politically. Lucas's films were so racist, so sexist. (I wish I could remember the name of the article we read in film class that compared Star Wars to Birth of a Nation.)</p>
<p>So while I was nervous about J. J. Abrams' revisioning of the Star Trek canon, I'm eager to see him hack at Star Wars'. If the trilogy follows a white woman and a black man, I will happily watch these films. Take my money, Disney.</p>
<p>Wait, who am I kidding. it's likely I'll happily watch them regardless.</p>
