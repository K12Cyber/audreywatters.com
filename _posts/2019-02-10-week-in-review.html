<p>It wasn&#8217;t a good week for writing. But we did sign a lease on an apartment, and while there is no furniture here other than a bed and two bar stools, we have a roof over our heads in a new city. This new city is experiencing the worst winter storm in decades, and that&#8217;s added a new twist to the challenges of furniishing it (with food, let alone with actual furniture). The next few weeks don&#8217;t look to be too good for writing either. I&#8217;m headed back to LA to pack up the old apartment. Then I&#8217;m headed east to speak at Austin Peay University. Then the IKEA furniture is coming. And then I can return to the book writing. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m not even going to bother to update the word count here. And I&#8217;m going to try to not to freak out about the April 1 deadline for the draft.</p>
