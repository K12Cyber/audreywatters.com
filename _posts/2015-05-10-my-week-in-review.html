<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m negotiating a change to the title of my next book <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em> &#8211; looks like it&#8217;s going to be <em>Claim Your Domain</em>.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve signed up for the edX MOOC on superheroes. It doesn&#8217;t formally start &#8217;til next week, but I&#8217;ve created a &#8220;hello world&#8221; post in the forums, so hey&#8230;</li>
<li>I got a new iPhone since my old one broke while in Europe.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m going to be writing an article for <em>Teaching Tolerance</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I finished Philip Sandifer&#8217;s <em>A Golden Thread: An Official Critical History</em>.</li>
<li>I started watching the new <em>Daredevil</em> series, but I think I'm so tired and jetlagged, I can't say if I like it. I'm sure it's better than the Affleck movie, right?</li>
