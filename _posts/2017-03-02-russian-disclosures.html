<p><em>Disclosure (because I guess we are supposed to be more forthright about this): I have connections with the Russians</em></p>

<p>I visited the Soviet Union in 1991. It was a school field trip. I traded rubles on the black market. I traded a Metallica t-shirt for a Red Army belt. I drank a lot of vodka. I bought a little pin of Lenin which I wore on my jacket in college, but I&#8217;m not sure what happened to it, darn it. I do still have a pin with the Bronze Horseman on it. It says Ленинград. I thought that city was the most beautiful I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>I fell in love with Russian literature. Poetry. Short stories. Science fiction. </p>

<p>I read everything by Tolstoy. I named my son after him. I sent some of Tolstoy&#8217;s pacifist writings to my little brother in an attempt to get him to drop out of the Air Force Academy.</p>

<p>I tried learning Russian in graduate school. I say &#8220;tried&#8221; because while I can still decipher the Cyrillic alphabet, it&#8217;s not a language that &#8220;stuck.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve watched <em>The Irony of Fate</em> only twice, but I think about it every New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>

<p>The work of Viktor Shklovsky was fairly influential on the shape my dissertation was taking. But since I dropped out of grad school, I have not had any communication with Russian Formalists.</p>
