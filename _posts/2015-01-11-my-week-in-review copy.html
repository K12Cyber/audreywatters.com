<h3>Reading</h3>
<br />
<p>I finished <em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy</em>; <em>Wolf in White Van</em>; and <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>. I started <em>Memory Machines</em> and <em>The Marvelous Land of Oz</em> (I&#8217;m going to read all the Oz books.) I resumed reading <em>Bad Feminist</em>.</p>

<h3>Family</h3>
<br />
<p>The kid started school this week. He&#8217;s enrolled in a phlebotomy program. &#8220;It&#8217;s weird and kinda scary being back in school,&#8221; he says.</p>
