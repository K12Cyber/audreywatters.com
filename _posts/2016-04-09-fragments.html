<p>I&#8217;m always in the process of reviewing and revising my &#8220;workflow&#8221; &#8211; how I work, what I work on, the technologies I utilize to do so. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve used GitHub Pages and Jekyll to run this and all my websites. I really like doing so, in no small part because it means I&#8217;m working mostly with HTML. I control my own infrastructure (and I will even more once I move everything to my own server, cutting out that GitHub middle-man).</p>

<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve also started using Known to post status updates as well as short notes. I call that site &#8220;Fragments&#8221; because the ideas I put there are, by and large, not fully fleshed out. There have been some positive and some negative side effects of that: I feel more comfortable throwing ideas &#8220;out there,&#8221; particularly since my Known site (aud.life) doesn&#8217;t have a lot of readers (unlike my blogs). But I also think that, as the name suggested, things are getting a bit fragmented.</p>

<p>What I <em>think</em> I&#8217;m going to do is copy all the &#8220;posts&#8221; I&#8217;ve made on my Known site to my main personal blog. I&#8217;ll back-date these, of course, and I&#8217;ll add a link that indicates the material was originally posted on aud.life.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> that means I'm going to start blogging more of those fragments here.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also toying with a move to Reclaim Hosting for my Known installation. What I <em>should do</em> is handle it myself, but it&#8217;s beyond the scope of my technical abilities at the moment (and frankly, I&#8217;d rather spend the time learning how to run Jekyll on my own server). We&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>
