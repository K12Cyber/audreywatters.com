<h3>Speaking</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Nope</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve filed (still more) paperwork on my dad&#8217;s estate</li>
<li>I booked an apartment for the kid and my trip to London in January</li>
<li>I bought my ticket to Educon</li>
<li>I signed the kid up for driving school</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve done quite a bit of work on all my various websites. They have new <a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/more-pigeon-pics">pigeon photos</a> for headers and each GitHub repo now has a blog where I hope to do a better job of writing updates for the status of each project</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I watched <em>The Martian</em></li>
<li>We rewatched <em>Star Wars: Episode 1-6</em>, but didn't get ourselves to the theatre to see <em>The Force Awakens</em> again</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kin&#8217;s daughter is here, staying with us for a few days</li>
<li>I talked to lots of family on Christmas Day (Kin and I don't really celebrate) and tried to have some good memories of Christmas Days past with my dad</li>
</ul>
