<p>As quoted in &#8220;The Case(s) Against Personalized Learning,&#8221; <a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/11/08/the-cases-against-personalized-learning.html">by Education Week&#8217;s Ben Herold</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>K-12 educators and policymakers should question the forces driving that narrative, said Audrey Watters, an independent researcher who maintains the popular Hack Education blog.</p>
<br />
	<p>The push for more personalized learning isn't happening in a vacuum, Watters maintained. The movement is emerging from the values and technologies that already define Silicon Valley. And it's clear how the companies behind those systems operate.</p>
<br />
	<p>"When Facebook promises personalization," Watters said, "it's really about massive data collection."</p>
