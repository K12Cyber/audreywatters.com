A friend asked me a couple of weeks ago to help him get started with freelance writing.  You know the type -- the "what should I do with this Bachelors Degree in English?" sort.  And I'm the tech blogger with the degree in Folklore, so I am super sympathetic, trust me. But I've been busy, still always meaning to give him a call, meet for coffee, and chat about some of the freelance writing jobs I've done, along with some of sites I've used to post my writing profile and my availability for work. <p></p>
I've also been weighing whether or not to write a little guide here on this blog about how to become a freelance writer.  <p></p>
I dunno though.  I simply took a leap of faith when I <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=414">quit</a> my job, and I'm really not sure I have much wisdom to share.  I like to learn and write, I get paid to learn and write.  I reckon I'm a decent writer.  I work hard, and I write a ton, and I love it.  I got lucky.  Here I am.  There you go.  <p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201006no_name.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201006no_name.jpg" alt="" title="no_name" width="240" height="240" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1137" /></a>But OK, if I had to say one thing about setting out on your own -- whether as a writer or with any sort of solo venture -- it would be to stress the importance of, well, <b>you</b>.  When you step out to work for yourself -- freelancer, entrepreneur, self-employed, whatever -- you need to establish yourself:  the quality of your work, your name, your <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=638">reputation</a>.  As a freelance writer in particular, you want people to know who you are, know what and how you write, and know that you're for hire.  And all that, of course, depends on the work you do being attached to your name in some way.  <p></p>
Am I right?  I mean, maybe I'm not.  (Hence the title of this blog post.) <p></p>
A former employer approached me to do some blogging for it but wanted me to do so anonymously, as a ghostwriter.  I was given an NDA to sign.  I balked.  Is that wrong?<p></p>
Now, there are plenty of folks who have made successful careers as ghostwriters, plenty of freelance writers who are willing to practice their craft but receive no credit for doing so.  I get that.<p></p>
But that's not what I do.  <p></p>
Oh, <i>I have done that</i>.  I did a few projects where I wrote things that weren't published under my name when I first started picking up writing jobs.  But that seems silly for me to do now.  I mean, I have a graduate degree in Folklore, for crying out loud.  <p></p>
In all seriousness, I feel like I have a reputation -- a name -- to uphold as a writer.  It's a carryover from my academic days, perhaps, where I take great pride in doing research, crafting analysis, invoking the semicolon. I want to uphold this reputation for the publications for which I write (although, sadly, I don't get to use the semicolon too often).  I want to uphold this reputation for me.  <i>It's my name.  It's my work.</i><p></p>
Oh maybe I'm just ranting.  I have authority and ego issues clearly, and they render me poorly equipped to offer guidance on becoming a freelance writer, I'm afraid --although I'd like to think they position me strongly to actually be one.<p></p>
