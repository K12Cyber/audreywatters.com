<p>Lately, I've gone from being very active on Facebook to being very active on Twitter. I can't really explain why I've found Facebook less and Twitter more attractive. (Well, I can, but it might involve hurt feelings and high school reunions.) While I do check in at least once a day on Facebook (I gotta take my turn kicking ass on Wordscraper, and I do care what my friends are up to, really I do), I find that Twitter has my attention pretty consistently throughout the day.</p>
<p>Whereas Facebook is primarily a site for personal social networking, Twitter is personal <em>and </em>professional. And although I'm friends on Facebook with a number of former grad school classmates and political comrades, I'm far more likely to find interesting articles and information linked by those I follow on Twitter. And finally, the real-time nature of Twitter facilitates sharing and discussion in a way that I find far more interactive, collaborative, and, well, just plain ol' useful than the "leave a comment" section of Facebook.</p>
<p>But between the 140 characters of Twitter and the four or so paragraphs of this blog (and beyond the personal/professional content I disseminate here and there), there's a gap, one that I've started to fill via <a href="http://audreywatters.posterous.com/" target="_blank">Posterous</a>. I'm trying to keep this site full of Good Ideas and Decent Writing (so I can get Work), and thus Posterous has become my go-to service for half-assed rants and miscellany.</p>
<p>And for the record, I'm still sorta "meh" about Google Buzz.</p>
