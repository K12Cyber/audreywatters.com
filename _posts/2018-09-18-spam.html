<p>I got an email this afternoon that there was spam on one of my subdomains. Turns out, there is spam on <em>both</em> audreywatters.com and hackeducation.com. Someone found a way to load pirated PDF files &#8211; yay, free and &#8220;open&#8221; e-books for everyone! &#8211; and host them on my websites. </p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ve fixed the problem. </p>

<p>&#8220;Someone&#8221; &#8220;found a way&#8221; &#8211; it was a good reminder to me how partial my knowledge is of domains and nameservers and DNS and the like. (I learned today about a vulnerability that allows your subdomains to be hijacked via GitHub pages, so that was fun.) All this is so frustrating as I constantly have to take measures to protect my safety online as a (woman) critic. And I just do not have the time or the technical know-how. This I do know: the Internet is full of trash.</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess it&#8217;s not the ol&#8217; pharma-hack, as I&#8217;m not on WordPress any longer. It&#8217;s pirated e-books, this time around. So that&#8217;s a neat little cultural marker, isn&#8217;t it. </p>
