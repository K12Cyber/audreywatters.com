<p>Twitter broke today.</p>
<p>It's the sort of excitement I'm not sure you can fathom if you're not a geek or a tech blogger.  I rolled out of bed this morning and into the RWW editorial room (working virtually FTW) to find all sorts of hullabaloo.  We had a tip about a Twitter exploit that would allow you to force someone to become your follower.  That's a pretty big deal for a site in which you can be completely selective as to whom you follow (and who follows you, in turn, grants you a significant amount of Twitter "cred").</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/i_accepted_jesus_and_now_hes_my_follower.php">Mike</a> quickly got Conan O'Brien (renowned for only following one person), Bill Gates, and Jesus to follow him (all in the service of investigative reporting, of course).</p>
<p>Me, I pulled up the Dalai Llama's profile.  And let the record show here, as I started to type "accept..." Kin stopped me.  "The Dalai Llama?" he said, "you're evil."</p>
<p>I'm trying <strong>not</strong> to be evil.  Really, I am.  (Although I guess I <em>am</em> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/05/09/fool-disclosure/">a whiny entitled dipshit</a>. But whatever.  I'll try to be a benign whiny entitled dipshit.)</p>
<p>Well hell, I thought.  I'm not going to do this whole follow exploit thing then.  I have my integrity blah blah blah.  Or more accurately, perhaps, I couldn't really think of who I'd want to strongarm into following me.  I mean, I genuinely like the Twitter celebs I know and follow -- Roger Ebert, Wil Wheaton, Neil Gaiman, and so on.  And I didn't really relish the idea of hacking their Twitterverse.</p>
<p>And then, it struck me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201005justin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-769" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="justin" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201005justin.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="161" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">WTF, I know. I am a little ashamed, ok?</p>
<p>But then I got busy with my day, and Twitter got busy fixing the exploit (temporary wiping out everyone's followers).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As the afternoon progressed, it appeared as though Bieber was going to stay my buddy.  He didn't disappear from my follower list.  And so, I started to scheme about how best to take advantage of this new relationship.  I couldn't help but think of <a href="http://blamedrewscancer.com/">Drew Olanoff</a>'s <a href="http://www.drewolanoff.com/post/549662411/dear-justinbieber-a-challenge">challenge</a> to Justin Bieber.  And I thought how -- GRRR -- Bieber's status as a trending topic has been known to outpace the number of discussions about major news events, including the Haiti earthquake.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was all prepared to DM Justin, and tell him that personally, I #blamecancer for unsolicited Twitter followers.</p>
<p>But by the time I got around to crafting my message, he'd stopped following me. Sadly. (I #blamecancer. I also blame Mondays.)</p>
<p>However, it does appear as though a fair chunk of tweens noticed he'd started to follow me.  And now, in turn, they're following me.</p>
<p>Punishment for being evil?  Or awesome (evil) opportunity?</p>
