<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2016/link-jacking-in-ed-tech">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>I've spent the last month or so researching the blockchain and its potential applications in education. I've spent the last week or so typing up my thoughts. This morning, I published a 5000-word piece --<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/04/07/blockchain-education-guide"> an introduction to the blockchain</a>, aimed at the ed-tech audience.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Edsurge published <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-04-07-considerations-for-blockchain">this</a>:</p>

<p>Oh sure, I'm linked if you click to "read more." My 5000 words of research are summarized in a sentence or two. But what Edsurge, a site with more readers and more Twitter followers and millions more in VC dollars than Hack Education, has done is effectively redirected traffic to their page and away from me.</p>
<p>That's some shady, disrespectful behavior right there.</p>
<p>One of the things I always appreciate about&nbsp;<a href="http://www.downes.ca/news/OLDaily.htm">Stephen Downes' OLDaily</a> is that when he features others' work, he puts a redirect in the headline so that clicking on the link in question <em>takes you to the original content</em>. That strikes me as much more ethical online behavior, one that builds a community of thinkers and writers in ed-tech rather than one that tries to funnel all news and information into one centralized location.</p>
