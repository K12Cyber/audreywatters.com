<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201006world_of_goo_logo_lg.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201006world_of_goo_logo_lg.jpg" alt="" title="world_of_goo_logo_lg" width="200" height="237" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1159" /></a>I feel silly as I type this:  The <a href="http://www.worldofgoo.com/">World of Goo</a>, a game involving building climbing structures out of balls of goo, is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in recent memory.<p></p>
I mean, I've killed a lot of dragons and shot a lot of zombies.  I've deprived a lot of Sims of food, toilets and front doors til they've died heartbroken (or died of a mysterious cooking accident, wink wink).  I've conquered civilization, raced cars, rescued princesses. I feel compelled to say this, to list this video-game-playing resume of sorts, because I think the description of 2D Boy's World of Goo sounds ridiculously banal:  the game involves manipulating balls of goo into soundly-structured goo frameworks so the balls can climb their way to a pipe to complete the level.  <p></p>
Weeeeeee!<p></p>
But damn, the game is fun.  Addictively fun.  <p></p>
As I went to write up my review of this game, I think I returned to World of Goo at least five times.  Ostensibly, I wanted to have more to say, more analysis of the graphics, perhaps, or the soundtrack.  Maybe I could say more about the puzzles the game presents, the challenges for each level.  Something about, errr, physics, maybe.  Or hey, there's a surrealist bent to the "instructions" the sign painter leaves on each level. <p></p>
But if you'd like a more erudite review, something about theme and meaning, read <a href="http://www.gameobserver.com/features/inside/all-platforms/we-are-world-of-goo-part-1-the-goo-filled-hills-211/">this.</a>  And excuse me while I return to World of Goo.  I've got goo to stack.
