<p>I&#8217;m going to be Hangout-ing with several folks later this week to talk about how to use Github and Jekyll in order to own your own domain. (This is how I run both Hack Education and this site, along with all my various projects.) I promised I&#8217;d give some pre-Hangout instructions, and I figured I&#8217;d blog them briefly here so others can follow along at home.</p>

<p><em>Wait. What is Jekyll? Why Github? WTF?</em></p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the thing. As a writer who works online, I&#8217;m quite adept at HTML. I&#8217;ve made the switch to Markdown too because I can focus on my words and not the markup. I&#8217;ve blogged for almost a decade now; I&#8217;ve hosted my own sites for over five years. But I&#8217;ve never really mastered the database and servers that power them. Not really. I&#8217;m lucky: my partner is an engineer, and he&#8217;s helped me with it. <em>But I really want to own my own domain and control my own domain.</em></p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve moved away from your standard blogging platforms &#8211; Wordpress, for example &#8211; and servers and storage &#8211; Amazon Web Services, in my case. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started using GitHub Pages, public Web pages hosted by GitHub and managed through its interface. (GitHub is a Web-based tool for open source code management and version control.) A repository, or &#8220;repo,&#8221; on GitHub can automatically generate pages, which are powered by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_%28software%29">Jekyll</a>. </p>

<p>You can run a &#8220;blog&#8221; with Jekyll &#8211; that is, a presentation of posts in reverse-chronological order. But I think it&#8217;s better and easier to think about these posts as individual, static Web pages. (That&#8217;s what they really are.) Take these static Web pages and tie them together however you want. It is, after all, your domain.</p>

<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A domain (whose DNS you can control)</li>
<li>A GitHub account</li>
<li>A text editor</li>
<li>A theme</li>
<li>GitHub&#8217;s desktop software (optional, but way easier)</li>
<li>Online file storage (that generates public URL) (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations and resources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Domain Registration: <a href="https://www.hover.com/">Hover</a></li>
<li>Domain Registration plus Hosting: <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim Hosting</a></li>
<li>My Jekyll theme: <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/mediator/">Mediator</a> (Others can be found <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">here</a>. Here is <a href="https://github.com/dajbelshaw/example">Doug Belshaw&#8217;s guide</a> to using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> with Jekyll.)</li>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Official Jekyll site</a> and documentation</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber&#8217;s Markdown</a> documentation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> (optional CDN, DNS and security tool)</li>
<li>I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> as my text editor. It&#8217;s expensive, and there are lots of free online alternatives. I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12">Byword</a> as my Markdown editor. Ditto for cheaper alternatives.</li>
