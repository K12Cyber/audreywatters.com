<p>2015 was another garbage year. To repeat <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2014/12/31/my-year-in-review/">what I wrote this time last year</a>, &#8220;The planet got hotter, and it sure felt like it got more violent.&#8221; </p>

<p>Good things happened in 2015, to be sure. But even more than 2014, this year delivered tragedy after tragedy, loss after loss. I&#8217;m relieved to have weathered it all&#8230; more or less. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written &#8220;<a href="http://audreywatters.com/2012/12/30/my-2012/">my year in numbers</a>&#8221;-type posts in the past, and I&#8217;ve done some of that accounting below. But I&#8217;m working on a different sort of reflection as well, one that tries to capture my feelings about the loss of my dad and my granny within days of each other this summer. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be able to get the words right, let alone publish it&#8230;</p>

<h3>Hermosa</h3>
<br />
<p>I think, but I haven&#8217;t done the math, that Kin and I spent more time &#8220;at home&#8221; this year. Of course, it helps to have a home. And this year we were happy to have a number of guests come and stay with us too.</p>

<h3>GitHub Updates</h3>
<br />
<p>Late last year, I moved all my various writing projects to GitHub. I use GitHub Pages (Jekyll) to run my websites. It&#8217;s been quite liberating for me to be able to better manage my infrastructure &#8211; or at the very least, to not have to worry about setting up a MySQL database every time I want to start a new blog.</p>

<p>I made 2590 commits on GitHub over the course of the last year, and as this graphic underscores, I worked almost every day:</p>

<h3>Awards</h3>
<br />
<p>It&#8217;s not really an award per se, but I was selected one of the &#8220;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Audrey-Watters-Casts-a/229371/?key=TGJ1d1ZkMyYWMCljMDYTYDlQbH1tMB96MnEYYix0bltVFQ==">Tech Innovators of 2015</a>&#8221; by The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>

<h3>The Business</h3>
<br />
<p>I didn&#8217;t make much money this year. I end the year more in debt than I&#8217;ve been in a long, long time thanks to a number of unforeseen circumstances. </p>

<p>(One thing I&#8217;d like to do in 2016 is be more transparent about where my income comes from: how much I make from book sales, how much I make from articles, how much I make from donations, how much I make from speaking gigs. I&#8217;d also like to find someone who&#8217;ll sponsor my <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends</a> project and give me enough money so I can make that an even smarter, more useful series.)</p>

<h3>At the Movies</h3>
<br />
<p>I saw just two movies in the theater this year: <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> and <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>. But I saw the former three times in the theater, and I'm a bit surprised I haven't gone back to see <em>Star Wars</em> again. I'm not sure these were my two most favorite movies this year, but they're the ones I left the house to see, so that counts for something.</p>

<h3>Music (Live/Recorded)</h3>
<br />
<p>I saw The Mountain Goats, Everlast, and Suns of Jimi play live. Favorite song of 2015: &#8220;King Kunta&#8221; by Kendrick Lamar. Favorite album: the <em>Hamilton</em> Broadway recording.</p>

<h3>Wildlife</h3>
<br />
<p>Beasts I saw in the Pilanesberg National Park: elephants, impala, zebra, white rhinos, wildebeests, springboks, giraffes, warthogs, lions, waterbucks, vivid monkeys, tsessebes, hippos, a leopard, a black-backed jackal, and a fish eagle.</p>

<p>Africa was truly the most sobering highlight of my year. Thank you, Tressie and Paul. I needed that.</p>
