<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And the bigger the fall, the bigger the joke. It would be better fun to throw a custard pie at a bishop than at a curate. - George Orwell</em>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Never doubt that a small, committed group of people with pies can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. - Subcommandante Tofutti</em>

My territory: I am the academic expert on political pie-throwing.<p></p>
Yes, you read that right. Screw being the leading scholar on 17th century Spanish poetry or on the Victorian novel. If someone's "pied," I'm the person you ask for insight and analysis. <em>The New York Times</em>, NPR, CNN -- they've all come to me for my two cents on the matter.<p></p>
I've published an essay on political pie-throwing -- the theory, the practice -- in <em>to the Quick</em> journal, and I contributed a chapter to <em>Pie Any Means Necessary: The Biotic Baking Brigade Cookbook</em>. Pie-throwing was the subject of Chapter 2 of my Master's Thesis in Folklore. The thesis examined political pranks as performances of radical humor and inversions of power enacted by groups like Earth First!, EAT (the Eugene Anarchists for Torrey), and the Biotic Baking Brigade.<p></p>
The latter -- those militant bakers -- were geniuses of both pastry and puns. And to this day, their spokesperson Agent Apple remains my hero. The ovens of subversion are cool now, but you never know when <em>les entartistes</em> might fire up the kitchens. There are plenty of political and corporate leaders who need their "just desserts."<p></p>
<!--more-->On February 4, 1998, Microsoft chairperson Bill Gates was in Brussels to meet with Belgian government officials and business people. As he climbed the steps to an office building, a group of activists known as the Patisserie Brigade Internationale pelted him with cream pies. Always on the heels of the corporate celebrity, the media were there to document the incident. Footage of Gates, his face smeared with the yellowy filling, graced both newspapers and television. This prank was the work of Belgian artist/writer Noël Godin. Many in Belgium were already familiar with Godin's pie?throwing antics, as he has performed similar stunts against European personalities for decades. With the Gates incident, pie?throwing was tossed into the spotlight worldwide. Though deliciously mischievous, Godin's actions are but a small "piece of the pie"; militant bakers everywhere have heeded a call to arms.<p></p>
The pie?in?the?face prank has a lengthy history with manifestations in popular and folk culture. This essay explores the history of pie?throwing as a political prank, with particular attention to the recent spate of pie?litical incidents. Like most pranks, pies are acts of ritualized inversion and humiliation. This essay focuses on the carefully crafted symbolism in these political pranks, evident in both the enactment and in the subsequent narratives and documentation. Although the performance of a prank has an immediate but limited audience, I argue that the impact of a prank takes on further layers of symbolism and importance through the media and through activist networks.
<p style="text-align: center;">Towards a (Disciplined) Theory of Pranks
A successful prank is a nuanced and well?crafted event, executed with strategic planning and with anticipated results. When combined with elements of parody and political wit, pranks can offer an entertaining act of social criticism. Pranks operate on, in, and through power
dynamics, inverting structures of status and convention. According to journalists V. Vale and Andrea Juno,<p></p>
"a prank connotes fun, laughter, jest, satire, lampooning, making a fool of someone ?? all light?hearted activities. Thus do pranks camouflage the sting of deeper, more critical denotations, such as their direct challenge to all verbal and behavioral routines, and their undermining of the sovereign authority of words, language, visual images, and social conventions in general. Regardless of specific manifestation, a prank is always an evasion of reality. Pranks are the deadly enemy of reality. And reality ?? its description and limitation ?? has always been the supreme control trick used by a society to subdue the lust for freedom latent in its citizens."<p></p>
Pranks are dramatic folk traditions, comically subversive performances, radical street theater. Political pranks draw on a long history of satire and parody in both performance and literature. Jesters and fools have long used humor to question and ridicule authority; modern?day activists continue to find the practical joke a useful and amusing tactic.<p></p>
