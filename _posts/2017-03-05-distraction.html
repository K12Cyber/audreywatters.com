<p>I grow weary of all this talk that certain things are "distractions" from "the real story."</p>
<p>I believe you can hold many ideas, multiple agitations and angers in your head all at once. You can pay attention to many stories. Really. You can.</p>
<p>See, I was widowed on August 29, 2005. And I was able to deal with the grief and horror of losing a husband on that day AND witness the grief and horror of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Human suffering knows no bounds. But nor should human compassion.</p>
<p>If you're worried about "distraction," maybe work on your own capacity, on your own empathy. Don't scold others who are attending to the world.</p>
