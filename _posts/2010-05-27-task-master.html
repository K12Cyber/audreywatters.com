Last week, I received the reminder notice from <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> that it was time to renew my premium subscription. Even though I have used RTM fairly consistently over the past year, I didn't immediately re-subscribe as I wanted to see what my options were for a task manager that would run me less than $25.<p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201005egretlist1_may10.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-855" style="margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="egretlist1_may10" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201005egretlist1_may10.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Because I read blogs for a living (yay me), I happened to notice Evernote <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/2010/05/26/egretlist-a-great-to-do-list-app-powered-by-evernote/">promoting</a> just the thing:  <a href="http://www.mindsmomentum.com/egretlist/">Egretlist</a>.  Evernote is another freemium service I've come to rely on - on my PC, on my iPhone, on my iPad - and Egretlist immediately appealed to me as it syncs with Evernote.<p></p>
Egretlist looks through your Evernote account to find notes with checkboxes, then allows you to arrange them as to-do lists within the app.  There seems to be lots of ways in which you can organize the lists -- as projects or responsibilities, for example -- and Egretlist allows you to attach notes, images or audio tothese lists.<p></p>
It's given me lots of ideas of how I can consolidate some of the various lists I have (currently handwritten on 3x5" notecards because I am a pro tech blogger, yo) -- brainstorming, deadlines, research for the different freelance writing jobs I juggle.<p></p>
And ironically, considering I wasn't ready to pony up the twenty-five bucks for Remember the Milk, this might be the thing that gets me to pay for a premium Evernote subscription.
