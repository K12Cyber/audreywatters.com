<p>Holy crap. 2018 is almost over. And I still have so much to do&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>I requested BF Skinner&#8217;s FBI file (although considering the federal government is shut down, I don&#8217;t expect to see this any time soon)</li>
</ul>

<br />
<ul>
<li>I made a lot of updates across all the various projects and websites I run &#8211; leaving a note on many of them that they wouldn&#8217;t be updated as I turn my focus elsewhere. I have one more end-of-year ed-tech article to finish writing today (and to publish tomorrow). And then the lights go off on Hack Education for a few</li>
</ul>
