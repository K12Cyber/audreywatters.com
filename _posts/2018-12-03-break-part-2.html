<p>On Saturday, I deleted the Twitter and Facebook apps, along with Facebook messenger and the app I use for RSS feeds, off my phone. I logged out of Twitter and Facebook on the browser on my laptop. I deleted the Slack and Facebook apps from my iPad. I clicked on the &#8220;screen limit&#8221; tools on that device, making Twitter, email, and RSS unavailable between the hours of 8am and 4pm.</p>

<p>I accomplished so much on Saturday that it blew my mind. That included making the most delicious meal I&#8217;ve ever cooked: a piece of black cod that I&#8217;d marinated in sake and miso since the night before, with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and rainbow chard. I briefly thought that damn, I couldn&#8217;t share this revelatory meal with anyone on social media. But I don&#8217;t really talk about food much there anyway. Kin and I enjoyed the fish. I told my son about it and promised to cook it when he next visits. And really, that is that.</p>

<p>I had another food related rant on my lips on Sunday when I went to the grocery store for sausage. For some reason, the existence of chicken sausage makes me incredibly angry, particularly when I am on the hunt for a cylindrical meat product made out of pig. This Californian penchant for chicken or turkey in the hopes of avoiding anything too fatty makes me furious. Fat is delicious. Chicken sausage is not. But really, that opinion is not worth a status update.</p>

<p>On page 106 of the book I was reading, I wanted to share the ideas rolling around in my head with a friend but realized I didn&#8217;t have his email address. (We DM a lot via Twitter.) Thankfully he lists it on his website, so I sent off this massive missive to his work address. (Sorry, Mike.)</p>

<p>I read that whole book in one day, uninterrupted by the siren song of Twitter. I also walked 4.5 miles and made homemade latkes for dinner. When I sat down at the end of the day with my iPad to see what I&#8217;d missed from my various feeds, I realized that the answer was &#8220;not much.&#8221; So I picked up a novel to read instead of spending the evening doing the &#8220;pull to refresh&#8221; motion and waiting for something interesting or infuriating to cross my path.</p>

<p>At this stage &#8211; and yeah, I realize it&#8217;s only Day 2 of my social media break &#8211; I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ll ever go back.</p>
