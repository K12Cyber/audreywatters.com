<p>We (that is, Bruce, Will Richardson, and I) determined this week that I&rsquo;ll be wrapping up my work as EML&rsquo;s editor at the end of this year.</p>
<h2>Teaching Machines</h2>
<p>I submitted a book proposal for <em>Teaching Machines</em>. I&rsquo;m hoping that, as I rethink the focus of my work, I&rsquo;ll be able to hammer out the rest of the book during the first few months of 2015.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>As part of DigiWriMo, I was a &ldquo;guest speaker&rdquo; and my piece &ldquo;Maggie&rsquo;s Digital Content Farm&rdquo; was published on the <a href="http://www.digitalwritingmonth.com/2014/11/04/maggies-digital-content-farm/">DigiWriMo blog</a> as well as on <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/maggies-digital-content-farm">Hybrid Pedagogy</a>.</p>
<p>I was a guest speaker at Pepperdine's graduate program in ed-tech this week, giving a <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/11/04/programmed-instruction-versus-the-programmable-web/">talk</a> on Tuesday evening about the history and future of ed-tech and conducting a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11izf0zfw4juH6dCGvuy5fdmQqPyvBifdJMYsA3zFc_c/edit">workshop</a> on Wednesday on ed-tech privacy and Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Tressie McMillan Cottom and I submitted an abstract for an article we&rsquo;re working on, &ldquo;Racializing Public Higher Education&rsquo;s Imagined Futures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got the word that Jose Vilson and I will be reprising our &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; at Educon on privilege.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m scrambling to finish all the talks I&rsquo;m scheduled to give in the coming weeks. This week, I worked on the one I&rsquo;m giving at NYU (pretty much done writing it) and the keynote I&rsquo;m giving at OpenCon (about two-third done with writing it).</p>
<p>Oh. And this happened: The Gamergate shitshow picked up on the excerpt from Hack Education that Mozilla ran on its Open Standard blog last week &ndash; me asking why ed-tech folks were ignoring GamerGate. So my <a href="https://medium.com/@cainejw/on-audrey-watterss-editorial-d0547d5ee792">mentions</a> and <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/firefox-twitter-wades-into-gamergate/">web alerts</a> were really fun and special and caring and thoughtful this week. Due to the GG frenzy, Mozilla then published a rebuttal to my piece &ndash; ya know, in the interest of representing &ldquo;both sides&rdquo; of the story. Whatever the hell that means. The Firefox Twitter account weighed in. Then the CEO of Mozilla apparently apologized (not <em>to me</em>&hellip; but for publishing my work). So I have decided that the Gamergate creeps are right about one thing: Mozilla does not have a strong ethical core at all, Firefox is a piece of shit, and I&rsquo;ll no longer use the browser or support the organization's work. I mean why the hell would I?</p>
<h2>Reading and Viewing and Listening</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still reading Gibson&rsquo;s <em>The Peripheral</em>. And, like many folks, I&rsquo;ve become a regular listener to the new <em>Serial</em> podcast. I have mixed feelings about it, particularly as it&rsquo;s so centered on the journalist and the convicted killer (innocent or not) and not on the victim.</p>
