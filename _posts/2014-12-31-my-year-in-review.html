<p>2014 was a garbage year. We lost Pete Seeger and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Williams and Stuart Hall and Maya Angelou and Gabriel García Márquez and Ruby Dee (and so many others). The planet got hotter, and it sure felt like it got more violent. </p>

<p>But 2014 was a great year too. (Thank you, Beyoncé. Thank you, Kin and José and Tressie and David and Chris and Kate and, again, so many others.)</p>

<p>It was a wonderful and awful and strange year for me &#8211; professionally and personally. Some of the highlights:</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<p>Destinations: Amsterdam, Arlington, Atlanta (x2), Austin, Barcelona, Berkeley, Berlin, Bolton, Bristol, Chicago, Coventry, Edmonton, Eugene (x2), Fredericksburg, Kamloops, Laguna Beach, Las Vegas, London (x2), Midhurst, Newcastle, New York City, Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, Stockholm, Vancouver, Washington DC (x2), and York.</p>

<p>It had been almost 25 years since I&#8217;d been back to England. I went there three times this year. I&#8217;m really thankful to have reconnected with a lot of my cousins (I have <em>the best</em> cousins) and to have seen my Granny (age 98). </p>

<p>I also visited old friends from high school and old friends from the Internet and old friends from previous chapters of my life. That was, beyond a doubt, the best part of the year. </p>

<p>2014 marked the 40th anniversary of <a href="http://youtu.be/3FsVeMz1F5c">ABBA winning the Eurovision Song Contest</a> with &#8220;Waterloo.&#8221; And I visited the ABBA Museum. The. Happiest. Place. On. Earth.</p>

<h3>Hermosa</h3>
<br />
<p>After living &#8220;permanent-address free&#8221; since August 2013, Kin and I decided to settle down. I rented an apartment! We bought furniture! But as you can see from the list of travel destinations above, we hardly sat still for a minute.</p>

<h3>Other Speaking Engagements</h3>
<br />
<p>I also spoke on panels and &#8220;conversations&#8221; at Educon, SXSWedu, the ALA Symposium, Digital Labor, and API Days Barcelona, as well as in multiple webinars.</p>

<h3>Educating Modern Learners</h3>
<br />
<p>I joined Will Richardson and Bruce Dixon&#8217;s new publication, <em>Educating Modern Learners</em>, as its founding editor and lead writer. The site had its official launch in April, and I&#8217;m really proud of the content that we published in its first year. I will no longer be the editor, but I&#8217;ll continue to contribute articles in 2015.</p>

<h3>Published Elsewhere</h3>
<br />
<p>I had articles appear in <em>Model View Culture</em>, <em>Australian Educational Leader</em>, <em>Boundary 2</em>, <em>Knowledge Quest</em>, WISE&#8217;s blog, and <em>Ed-Tech Magazine</em>.</p>

<h3>Awards</h3>
<br />
<p>I was surprised to learn in November that I&#8217;d been awarded a $5000 Shuttleworth Foundation Flash Grant.</p>

<h3>Books (By Me!)</h3>
<br />
<p>I published <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> in December (a collection of all my talks). I also signed a book contract for <em>Reclaim Your Domain: Building Learner-Centered Technologies</em>, coming next year. And I swear &#8211; I swear &#8211; I&#8217;m going to finish <em>Teaching Machines</em> in 2015 too.</p>

<h3>Books (By Others)</h3>
<br />
<p>I read: <em>The Peripheral</em>, <em>The People&#8217;s Platform</em>, <em>This is Not a Test</em>, <em>Gone Girl</em>, <em>The Glass Cage</em>, <em>The Epic Struggle of the Internet of Things</em>, <em>Geek Sublime</em>, <em>Redshirts</em>, <em>We Have Never Been Modern</em>, <em>The Teacher Wars</em>, <em>Aramis, or, The Love of Technology</em>, <em>Lock In</em>, <em>Robogenesis</em>, <em>The Giver</em> (and all the sequels), <em>Robopocalypse</em>, <em>Walden Two</em>, <em>How We Became Posthuman</em>, <em>Hild</em>, <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>, <em>Rainbow&#8217;s End</em>, <em>Distrusting Educational Technology</em>, <em>It&#8217;s Complicated</em>, along with a bunch of books that I started but <a href="http://austinkleon.com/2014/10/17/33-thoughts-on-reading/">didn&#8217;t finish</a>.</p>

<h3>The Business</h3>
<br />
<p>I don&#8217;t make a lot of money traveling and speaking and freelancing. Indeed, some of my <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/12/31/most-popular-posts-of-2014/">most popular talks</a> earned me nothing (except maybe a travel reimbursement). But I was able to pay off a credit card this year &#8211; debt that I&#8217;d been carrying forward for almost a decade. And I am no longer in default on my student loans. So that&#8217;s a start, I guess.</p>

<h3>Tattoos</h3>
<br />
<p>3</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<br />
<p>I bought the iPhone 6. I hate it. It&#8217;s too big and barely fits in my hand or my pocket.</p>

<p>I quit Facebook, LinkedIn, and Evernote. I deleted my Uber account. I deleted my Klout account. I cut way back on my usage of Foursquare (Swarm). I&#8217;ve moved my feeds off of Feedburner. I ditched Google Analytics. I&#8217;m also trying to ditch Gmail &#8211; that&#8217;s a bit tougher. Lesson learned: we sign up for a lot of extraneous bullshit, and those companies hoard our data.</p>

<p>I started using Slack&#8230; but when you&#8217;re self-employed it&#8217;s sorta lonely. I did join a Slack full of writers, which has been pretty great.</p>

<p>I started using both BlockBot and Block Together, making my Twitter world so much more enjoyable. I currently block about 4000 people on Twitter, mostly racists and <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844">Goober-gaters</a> and their sock-puppet accounts.</p>

<p>I recently moved my sites <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2014/12/25/jekyll/">to Jekyll</a>. And I&#8217;ve added Cloudflare protection. Because haters.</p>

<p>I also ponied up for ThinkUp. I&#8217;m not really into analytics or "social media monitoring," but I like the emails that I get from ThinkUp about my Twitter usage. And I like supporting good, small tech companies (like Pinboard and Noun Project, whose services I also happily pay for).</p>

<h3>Other Screens</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ll just mention a few favorites: <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, <em>Grand Budapest Hotel</em>, and <em>Snowpiercer</em>. I don&#8217;t remember the last time I saw a movie in a theatre, and I&#8217;m still catching up on 2013 releases. Oh well.</p>

<p>The new apartment has cable, so I've watched a lot more TV in the last year than in the last decade. I still enjoy <em>The Walking Dead</em>. I hate-watch a lot of Food Network shows.

<h3>Live Music</h3>
<br />
<p>Damn, I still suck at this. Camper Van Beethoven. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the only band I saw live. (I did see Bill Maher live too.) Favorite new album of 2014: The Black Keys&#8217; <em>Turn Blue</em>.</p>

<h3>The Kid</h3>
<br />
<p>The kid turned 21. Yes, I have an adult child. I think that makes me officially old. 2015 will be the 10th anniversary of Anthony&#8217;s death. I know that makes us officially survivors.</p>

<p>There were moments in 2014 where I thought I would crumble. But I&#8217;m strong and fierce, and the struggle continues&#8230;</p>
