<p><a href="http://audreywatters.com/2018/08/20/blogging">The IKEA furniture finally arrived last night</a>.</p>

<p>When we were moving into this apartment, my niece asked me if we still had our old couch, a giant thing that wrapped around the living room in our old Hermosa Beach apartment. It was red. Red red, not some subtler shade softened with a touch of brown or purple. Red.</p>

<p>It was a memorable couch, no doubt. A bold decorating decision. And sadly a piece of furniture that did not make the trip east with us &#8211; it never would have fit in our NYC apartment and it was too big for storage.</p>

<p>When I ordered new living room furniture for this new place, despite Amelia&#8217;s pleas, I opted to go with a different color scheme &#8211; somewhat limited by the style of armchair Kin insisted upon and the color in which IKEA upholstered its matching sofa.</p>

<p>I went with &#8220;beige-yellow&#8221; thinking that it would be bright and that the color would go nicely with some of the art hanging on the living room wall. (Most notably, a cat print that I bought at the ABBA Museum in Stockholm.)</p>

<p>As we unboxed and assembled everything last night, that &#8220;beige-yellow&#8221; was a bit surreal. The set reminded me of the color and texture of furniture at my grandma&#8217;s house &#8211; or perhaps at my great aunt&#8217;s. I couldn&#8217;t remember who had the yellow sofa, who had the yellow chair. Maybe both of them did. I did not recall noticing in the IKEA description that my new furniture would be covered in a velvet-like material. But I suddenly could recall the feel of my great aunt&#8217;s furniture: velvet stripes, the softness interspersed with a stiffer canvas-like material. The sofa in my grandmother&#8217;s living room was orange and scratchy. I think. (But I was always more comfortable at her house.)</p>

<p>I texted my brother, who was incredibly (impressively) quickly able to text me back with a number of photos of me at various ages sitting on various sofas in various family members&#8217; houses. And to my horror (and, yes, to my glee), it appears with this new furniture, I am maintaining a longstanding family tradition of rather hideous and quite glorious yellow sofas. </p>
