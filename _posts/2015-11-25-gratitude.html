<p>2015 has been a really terrible year for me, and I&rsquo;m glad that we&rsquo;re quickly approaching its end. It&rsquo;s not as though things get magically better when we flip the calendar over to January. But I&rsquo;m looking forward to 2016 nonetheless. Ugh. Except for that whole presidential election thing.</p>
<p>Despite the awfulness, I have so much to be grateful for: my health, my work, my friends, my family.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for Kin, who has put up with me during all the times I&rsquo;ve collapsed into tears and fury. I&rsquo;m thankful for Fred &ndash; that we could bravely face a pretty shitty situation in Casper together. I&rsquo;m thankful for Isaiah, who has proven to be the bravest kid. I'm thankful for my mom's support through all of this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for all the people from whom I learn every day, particularly Tressie and Jose. I&rsquo;m thankful for those friends who&rsquo;ve cried with me. I&rsquo;m thankful Chris, who&rsquo;s the busiest person I know and still has time to be a solid friend. I&rsquo;m thankful for Kate, who I finally met face-to-face this year and who has held me while we stared into a deep pit of despair.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful for the people who read my work. I&rsquo;m thankful for the people who listen to me speak &ndash; particularly those who know I&rsquo;m going to say something that makes people feel a little uncomfortable and who still welcome me at their events.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful that there are people who care, that there are people who take to the streets in protest, that there are those who work tirelessly for social justice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful I live in the sunshine, even when the world seems so dark.</p>
