<li>I established a goal of writing 800 words a day. It&#8217;s a pretty pathetic goal, I realize, but I&#8217;d rather not set myself up with a target that I have to struggle to hit, particularly when I get to some of the rougher patches in my thinking. I&#8217;m working on sections of the book right now that pertain to Skinner &#8211; and I will be for a while. He&#8217;s a key figure, of course, and my visit to his archives this spring was really fruitful. I wrote over 10,000 words since January 1, bringing the total so far of the <em>Teaching Machines</em> draft to 18,000. (That other 8000 was from the sample chapter I wrote for Sam Freedman&#8217;s class)</li>

<ul>
<li>I did a few end-of-year tasks, deleting everything I&#8217;d posted on Facebook in the year, for example, and backing up all my GitHub projects</li>

<li>Well, I don&#8217;t think that 2019 is going to be a record-setting for book reading on my part. I haven&#8217;t cracked a single one open yet this year. By the time I&#8217;m done writing each day, all I have energy to do is make dinner and go to bed</li>
