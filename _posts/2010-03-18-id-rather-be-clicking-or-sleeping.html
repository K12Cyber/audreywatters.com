I've got a post in the works on the sociology of social gaming... or something along those lines. I've been reading <a href="www.infosolutionsgroup.com/2010_PopCap_Social_Gaming_Research_Results.pdf" target="_blank">a report on the demographics of social gamers</a> and the impetus they gave researchers for why they play. And I saw a news item today stating that <a href="http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2010/03/18/zynga-was-paypals-second-largest-merchant-in-2009/" target="_blank">Zynga was Paypal's second largest merchant in 2009</a>.  I've been thinking about the social gamer/hardcore gamer divide, but also the social media early adopter/moms playing Farmville divide.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/progresswars.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-431" style="margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="progresswars" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201003progresswars-300x120.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="120" /></a>But as I mentioned in <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=414" target="_blank">yesterday's post</a>, I've also been thinking about the work-life balance, and noticing as I have been insanely busy lately (read: insane), that I haven't had time for any gaming. My Fallen London character hovers around the same level she was a couple of weeks ago <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=308" target="_blank">when I blogged about the game</a>. I don't think I've finished a game of Scrabble or Wordscraper this week.<p></p>
And I'm even too tired to say anything witty about <a href="http://progresswars.com/" target="_blank">Progress Wars</a>, a rather amusing parody of social gaming (but really -- and here's something I'll address in my post-yet-to-be-written, I hope -- <strong>all gaming is clicking</strong>). But hell, I'm even too tired to click.
