<p>Today was Twitter's first developers' conference, <a href="http://chirp.twitter.com" target="_blank">Chirp</a>. They made a lot of interesting announcements, including the release of <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/just_the_facts_statistics_from_twitter_chirp.php" target="_blank">some pretty impressive statistics</a>. They've added a <a href="http://dev.twitter.com" target="_blank">developer channel</a> which contains a lot of information for those planning to develop Twitter-based applications.</p>
<p>Following their incredibly easy directions, I've added the new @anywhere feature to this blog.</p>
