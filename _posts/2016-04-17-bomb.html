<p><em>&#8230;Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been loosely tracking &#8220;<a href="http://funding.hackeducation.com">who&#8217;s funding ed-tech</a>&#8221; for a couple of years now. But I&#8217;ve really only maintained detailed records for the last year, and I&#8217;ve always got questions involving a longer view of ed-tech trends (something that you can glean, in part, from watching the herds of investors flock from idea to idea). I would like to be able to list all the investors who&#8217;ve been part of this most recent &#8220;boom&#8221; in ed-tech funding, and so this past week I started wading through <a href="http://hackeducation.com/archives.html">old stories on Hack Education</a> in order to make that list. (Yes, I probably could have done this programmatically via <a href="http://crunchbase.com">Crunchbase</a>. Or I could have paid an investment analysis firm for the data. But I&#8217;d like to collect it myself from stories I&#8217;ve written myself. If nothing else, that means I can make it freely available to others.)</p>

<p>Reading through old articles is a little painful, as both the style and content of my writing on Hack Education has changed <em>a lot</em> over the course of its own meager history. I started the site in May of 2010 with a great deal of excitement about chronicling the latest in education technology &#8211; I figured I&#8217;d do what I was assigned to do more broadly as a &#8220;tech blogger&#8221; for ReadWriteWeb but for ed-tech. I'd write about product and funding news, mostly. But it&#8217;s pretty striking as I work my way through the site's archives that, less than a year and a half after I started, I had already become completely disillusioned by this particular crop of ed-tech &#8220;innovations&#8221; &#8211; the innovators and their investors.</p>

<p>So what changed? What happened?</p>

<p>I started spending time in Silicon Valley, for starters. I went to a lot of hackathons. I heard a lot of pitches.</p>

<p>I could see the gulf between what teachers &#8211; particularly progressive, technology-using teachers &#8211; wanted and what entrepreneurs and investors wanted. I knew a lot of teachers (I&#8217;d worked at ISTE for eighteen months immediately prior to becoming a &#8220;tech blogger&#8221;); I talked to teachers; I considered them my colleagues and my friends. The entrepreneurs and investors I met didn&#8217;t seem to know a lot of teachers. They didn&#8217;t like teachers. They considered them obstacles. I met plenty of ed-tech entrepreneurs who had been in TFA; but they considered their teaching experience a transitory step on the path to &#8220;better things.&#8221;</p>

<p>No surprise, many of the things they built were at best silly and at worst dangerous.</p>

<p>I could see the tech industry&#8217;s seething hatred for the education system, particularly for unions &#8211; they made no attempts to hide it. The more I learned about venture capital, the more I saw how incompatible it was to the public endeavor of education. The closer I looked at &#8220;the business of ed-tech,&#8221; the more I saw incumbent corporations &#8211; the testing and textbook industry &#8211; behind the venture funding and the dominant narratives. This was no &#8220;disruption&#8221; of these corporations&#8217; economic or political power. It was a solidification of it.</p>

<p>I became more and more uneasy with &#8220;the business of ed-tech&#8221; the more I spent time writing about it. The more I poked at the stories that ed-tech entrepreneurs and their investors and their PR teams told, the more questions I had. The more questions I had, the less willing these folks became to talk to me.</p>

<p>Reading through the archives of Hack Education for this latest funding research project, it&#8217;s so clear that two events really crystallized how I&#8217;ve come to think about the ed-tech industry. And that&#8217;s the response I received from writing critiques of <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2011/07/19/the-wrath-against-khan-why-some-educators-are-questioning-khan-academy">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2011/10/28/codecademy-and-the-future-of-not-learning-to-code">Codecademy</a> at the height of their popularity. I wrote the former in July 2011 and the latter in October 2011. And that&#8217;s when the hacking attempts on my websites started. That&#8217;s when I started getting hate mail. That&#8217;s when the death and rape threats started too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you hate ed-tech?&#8221; ed-tech evangelists often ask me. &#8220;And if you hate ed-tech so much, why do you write about it?&#8221; But see, I don&#8217;t hate ed-tech. (I hate injustice. I hate exploitation.) At some point, however, certain folks in (near, adjacent to) ed-tech decided they hate me. So, yeah, I guess that changed the stakes for me personally &#8211; personally and politically and philosophically &#8211; about how I work and what I work on and why. If nothing else, it's made me more furious and more curious.</p>

<p>And the writing and thinking and research I do now? <em>I love it</em>.</p>
