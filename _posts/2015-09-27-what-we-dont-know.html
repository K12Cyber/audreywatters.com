<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/what-we-dont-know">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I was at an API event chatting with <a href="http://twitter.com/wiredhead">@wirehead</a> about my progress on <em>Teaching Machines</em> and about the history of education psychology and education automation, when he made a really sharp observation that&rsquo;s stuck with me since: &ldquo;<strong>In a couple of hundred years, people will view our &lsquo;science of the mind&rsquo; much like we now view &lsquo;the humours&rsquo;</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The humours: the ancient but long-standing theory that the human body is filled with (by the Greek&rsquo;s accounts) four substances &ndash; blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm corresponding to air, fire, earth, and water respectively &ndash; that when out of balance, cause disease. We can scoff, I suppose, as &ldquo;science&rdquo; now tells us otherwise. But for a long time the humours <em>did</em> inform science; at least, they certainly informed medicine. Those who believed in the humours were not un- or anti-scientific.</p>
<p>And despite &ldquo;knowing better&rdquo; now, the humours haven&rsquo;t disappeared from the way in which we see personality or well-being. If nothing else, we still carry with us today this idea that staying healthy is all about &ldquo;balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience &ndash; all we think we know about thinking and knowing &ndash; will some day sound as silly as the stuff that Hippocrates wrote around 400 BC. Some of it already does. That&rsquo;s not to say these aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;science&rdquo; &ndash; they&rsquo;re just primitive. Some of what we thought we knew about &ldquo;the mind&rdquo; has already been challenged &ndash; Freud&rsquo;s contributions, for example, not to mention <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/28/science/many-social-science-findings-not-as-strong-as-claimed-study-says.html?_r=0">the field&rsquo;s (non-) replicability</a>, its racism.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/is-psychology-a-e2809creale2809d-science-does-it-really-matter/">none of that really matters</a>, does it? Shouting &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a real science&rdquo; gets us nowhere. With or without &ldquo;proof&rdquo; we seem to be increasingly convinced of and by &ldquo;the science of the mind.&rdquo; We know it works, mostly by the bestsellers and the advertisements, and as such we seek its insights.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s accurate or not, &ldquo;the science of the mind&rdquo; &ndash; even as a nascent field of study &ndash; has already had profound implications for social behaviors, expectations, and institutions.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in education, which purports to be about &ldquo;the mind&rdquo; &ndash; intelligence, knowledge, expertise and the practices to extend those things from one generation or one body to the next.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s even moreso for education technology which <em>literally</em> has its roots in the field of psychology. So if psychology is today&rsquo;s &ldquo;humours,&rdquo; what does that mean for the tools that we&rsquo;re building to implement its core beliefs?</p>
