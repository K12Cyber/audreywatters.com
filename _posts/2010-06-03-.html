With AT&amp;T in the news yesterday, I should probably write about my thoughts on my frustrations with the service over the weekend.  Because seriously, data plan price changes or not, I'm done. But if I don't start writing my band-by-band review of Sasquatch tonight, the details will slip my mind. (I'm old, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=860">remember</a>?)<p></p>
So before I forget, on Saturday we saw...<p></p>
<strong>Brad</strong>:  I'd never heard of this band before, the only band we saw over the weekend of whose songs I'd never heard.  And maybe that's not the best way to kick of a review of a series of bands - by confessing your ignorance.  But there you go.  Brad.  Huh.  Whatever.  And they were alright, I guess, but when you see twenty-one amazing bands in one amazing weekend, "alright" puts you near the bottom.  The vocalist was good, don't get me wrong.  But that's really all I can say.  And hell, I can't even link the band's website, because seriously, "Brad"?!<p></p>

I've loved this band a long time, and so I knew and loved every single song they played.  But I think the genius of OK Go is in their videos, and in their performance at Sasquatch, they didn't really translate any of that into their stage performance.  That being said, Tim Nordwind is the prototypical hipster and his blue suit made me ridiculously happy.  This was the band that kicked off the weekend for me.<p></p>
<strong><a href="http://www.brokensocialscene.ca/">Broken Social Scene</a></strong>:  I heard a lot of folks say this was their favorite performance.  We actually didn't catch the whole thing, thanks to a ridiculously long line getting yakisoba noodles.  But what we did see, I liked a lot.  It's one of several bands from the weekend that I need to circle back to and listen to more of.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/thenational.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-870" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="thenational" src="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/thenational.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a><strong><a href="http://www.americanmary.com/">The National</a></strong>:  I've always liked The National.  But wow, I absolutely love them now.  Their performance was incredible; it outshone their studio recordings, I'd say. Lead singer Matt Berninger really led the band in conveying incredible emotional intensity. And despite wanting to savor all the bands I heard over the weekend, I've been on a The National listening spree since.<p></p>
<strong><a href="http://www.vampireweekend.com/">Vampire weekend</a></strong>: They nailed it.  Their live performance was as flawless as their albums (which I don't mean to sound as an insult when compared to The National, but there you go). Their banter was witty and cheerful.  And gosh, they just seem like swell guys.  Seriously.  I danced my ass off.  We all did.<p></p>
<strong><a href="http://www.mymorningjacket.com/">My Morning Jacket</a></strong>:  After an afternoon and evening full of such awesome music, it seemed almost too much to have it capped off with My Morning Jacket.  And maybe that's why I fell asleep.  (I know.  Old.)  But before I did, I gotta say, they rocked it.<p></p>
