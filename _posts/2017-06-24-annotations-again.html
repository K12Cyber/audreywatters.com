<p>It&#8217;s been well over a month since I <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2017/04/26/no-annotations-thanks-bye">blocked</a> annotations (Hypothesis and Genius) on my websites. I&#8217;m a little taken aback that some folks are still muttering about it. Perhaps I need to restate a couple of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>You can still annotate my work</em>. Just not on my websites.</li>
<li>My work here and on Hack Education is openly licensed. As long as you follow that license &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC BY NC SA</a> &#8211; you can copy and redistribute my articles without my permission.</li>
<li>The CC license on my work also means you can post my articles in another file format or medium &#8211; that is, they needn&#8217;t stay in HTML. You can publish my articles as PDFs. You can hit &#8220;print.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>Jon Udell, who now works for Hypothesis and who I finally met face-to-face at NMC last week, has <a href="http://jonudell.net/h/annotation-preferences.html">suggested</a> the possibility of using an HTML meta tag to identify annotation preferences. Rather than simply blocking annotations as I&#8217;ve done with a bit of Javascript, his idea would allow an author to point to another URL where annotation can (or should, even) happen. </p>

<p>It makes sense, but I think I&#8217;m much less committed to having one canonical &#8220;place&#8221; for annotations than Hypothesis is. (I have quotations there because its annotations are overlays that appear to be in &#8220;place.&#8221;) </p>

<p>Udell recently <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/blog/dois/">announced</a> that Hypothesis supports DOIs (digital object identifiers) so that a &#8220;robust connection between articles and annotations&#8221; can be maintained. That is to say, Hypothesis annotations of a PDF can be centralized, no matter where the article is hosted or whether it&#8217;s a local copy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I care much about federated or centralized annotations &#8211; as a researcher or as an author. Actually, as an author, I do not care at all. Funnily enough, one of the accusations lobbed against me when I blocked annotations here was that I was attempting to exert some sort of &#8220;authorial control&#8221; over my work. Wrong. I was exerting <em>control over my website</em>. </p>

<p>We seem to have telescoped authorship and scholarship into the digital in ways that are remarkably unhelpful. People become &#8220;content,&#8221; and calls for easier, more &#8220;permission-less sharing&#8221; seem to encourage folks to make demands on writers online (even in their own personal spaces), thinking they&#8217;re simply querying texts.</p>
