<p>Last year was <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2015/12/31/year-in-review-1/">such a horrific year</a> that I haven&#8217;t spent much time thinking about or planning for what the new year will bring. I&#8217;ve been waiting for the day when I could shake off 2015&#8217;s traumas and start to move forward again. But I&#8217;m not sure January 1 brought that day. In fact, I&#8217;m sure it hasn&#8217;t as there are still many loose ends &#8211; legal and otherwise &#8211; to resolve from all of last year&#8217;s struggles. So for the first time in a while, I have rung in a new year without a plan, without goals, without resolutions. I&#8217;m still numb, still sad, still so tired.</p>

<p>Certainly I&#8217;d like to finish <em>Teaching Machines</em> this year. That was my intention in 2015 too, until everything went to hell in June. Now the book project weighs pretty heavily on me &#8211; something I feel I must complete but have lost almost all momentum. People continue to ask when the book will be published, and all I can say is &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I just finished reading George R. R. Martin&#8217;s <a href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/465247.html">blog post</a>, confessing that he won&#8217;t have <em>The Winds of Winter</em> done before Season 6 of <em>Game of Thrones</em> airs this spring. The expectations and pressures are far far greater for Martin no doubt, but I can relate to his feelings of letting down readers and disappointing himself. But like Martin, I said I was going to do this thing (well, he has a publishing contract too) and I just want to put it all to rest. So finish <em>Teaching Machines</em> I will. Or I will try.</p>

<p>I have thought a lot over the last year about putting my work in ed-tech to rest too. I suppose that partly explains the lack of enthusiasm I have for identifying the projects I&#8217;ll work on in 2016. The work I do is often much more exhausting than rewarding. I fight with fury for a better future for education technology, but the past two years have really zapped me. I have a couple of new topics I&#8217;d like to start writing about totally unrelated to ed-tech, but I do feel like I need to wrap up <em>Teaching Machines</em> first. (To be clear: I won't leave ed-tech behind in 2016. Everything does feel a little grim right now, and I haven't rested enough over the holidays. But I'm too stubborn to quit.)</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t scheduled many speaking events this year. There aren&#8217;t any keynotes on my calendar yet. Perhaps I&#8217;ll be asked to speak; perhaps people are sort of tired of my doomsaying. Kin and I have talked a lot about traveling less this year; certainly that will help me to write more. I was incredibly prolific during December when I stayed home: 65K words on my &#8220;<a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015</a>&#8221; series. </p>

<p>Some days, I think I would like to increase the visibility of some of my writing in the new year. I find many of the headlines in major publications about ed-tech frightfully dumb. Then again, when everything fell apart last summer, I was forced to ditch several high profile writing projects. (Thank goodness for kill fees, I guess.) I don&#8217;t want to get a reputation for being a flake, and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m back up to full speed yet. Moreover, I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about writing regularly elsewhere &#8211; I really do love the work I do on Hack Education. My confidence isn't too high right now either (obviously). Ideally I can find a sponsor or funder to pay for my &#8220;trends&#8221; work this year, and that&#8217;ll relieve the pressure of having to travel and speak or having to pitch other publications to make ends meet.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see.</p>
