<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/turkle-reviledrevisited">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of women who (<a href="http://www.jenniferhoward.com/blog/2013/05/do_women_have_big_ideas/">get to</a>) write &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo; books about technology. I can only name a handful. But one of them, Sherry Turkle, has a new book coming out.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in marketing mode at the moment, with a recent <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/09/26/443480452/making-the-case-for-face-to-face-in-an-era-of-digital-conversation">interview with NPR&rsquo;s Scott Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/stop-googling-lets-talk.html">an op-ed in The New York Times</a>. Jonathan Franzen, who&rsquo;s become quite the joke himself, has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/books/review/jonathan-franzen-reviews-sherry-turkle-reclaiming-conversation.html">reviewed the book for the NYT</a> as well, which is probably just the latest excuse some folks need to make fun of Turkle&rsquo;s ideas in turn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m frequently struck by how ungenerous the readings of her work often are by those in education technology. Her previous book, <em>Alone Together</em>, has been reduced to a caricature &ndash; an anti-technology screed, one that refuses to recognize that any good &ldquo;connection&rdquo; can come from computer technologies, one that insists, in a parallel to Nicholas Carr&rsquo;s claims (or at least a caricature of <em>his</em> work) that &ldquo;the Internet is making us stupid,&rdquo; that the Internet is making us anti-social.</p>
<p>I only recently read <em>Alone Together</em>, as I didn&rsquo;t realize &ndash; based on the tweet-length reviews of it I&rsquo;d seen from educators, I guess &ndash; that it addressed artificial intelligence at length. (Most of the responses I&rsquo;d seen focused on what it purportedly said about social media and social networking.)</p>
<p>Me, I&rsquo;m really interested in our views of and reactions to robots, particularly the push from certain quarters that we accept their inevitability. I found the book to be quite provocative, especially as she examines the development of &ldquo;caring machines&rdquo; &ndash; this has significant implications for ed-tech and for teaching machines, as I argued <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/08/10/digpedlab/">in my keynote this summer at UW Madison</a>. (Turkle points out that companion robots are introduced to children and the elderly &ndash; &ldquo;the most vulnerable&rdquo; &ndash; first. Ed-tech trivia: Some of Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s early work was on <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publication_view.html?pub_id=4824">building robots for nursing homes</a>.)</p>
<p>When Turkle writes that &ldquo;there is psychological risk in the robotic moment,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m reminded that her background is in psychology (not, say, in cultural studies or history or educational technology). This shapes her methodology; this shapes her analysis. The emphasis in that phrase &ndash; &ldquo;there is psychological risk in the robotic moment&rdquo; &ndash; shouldn&rsquo;t be on &ldquo;the robotic moment.&rdquo; That is, I don&rsquo;t think that Turkle is writing with a nostalgia for a time in the past in which social connections were whole and healthy (as some have suggested). The emphasis should be on &ldquo;psychological risk.&rdquo; In other words, I think Turkle has this sense of whole and healthy Self as informed by psychoanalysis, not by history. That Self is challenged by many things &ndash; all sorts of traumas, losses, needs, desires, vulnerabilities &ndash; and one of the new challenges is computer technology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think psychology explains everything. Not even close. (My background, of course, is in literary and cultural studies.) I think history matters &ndash; indeed, I&rsquo;m really interested in the relationship between the history of educational psychology and the history of ed-tech. And I insist that structure matters too &ndash; institutions, cultures, societies, systems &ndash; and I wonder if psychology focuses on the individual at the expense of all that. (Does this explain, I wonder, why Turkle&rsquo;s work sometimes feels like it veers towards white middle class anxiety?) I wonder if psychology of tech focuses too much on the individual <em>and</em> the tech.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not really interested in defending Turkle. But it is interesting to me that it&rsquo;s <em>her</em> books (as opposed to male critics of tech) that seems to elicit the most negative responses from those in ed-tech &ndash; responses that seem to often put words in her mouth. Hmm.</p>
<p>And I do admit, I&rsquo;ve got some fondness for Turkle: I first read Turkle&rsquo;s work as an undergrad in a women&rsquo;s studies class in the early 1990s. More accurately, I first read Turkle and her (then) husband Seymour Papert&rsquo;s work as an undergrad in a women&rsquo;s studies class. I learned of Papert through Turkle, and the former has shaped my thoughts on ed-tech profoundly. It&rsquo;s my own nostalgia, I realize, for books in the 1980s &ndash; for a different moment &ndash; that could be so hopeful about tech.</p>
