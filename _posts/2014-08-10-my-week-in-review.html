<h2>Teaching Machines</h2>
<p>I finished the draft of the chapter on BF Skinner and programmed instruction, and I started work on the draft of chapter on &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; humans and &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; machines.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I received confirmation of a speaking gig in October 2015 in South Africa, confirmation of a speaking gig in February 2015 in Toronto, and confirmation of a speaking gig next month in Newcastle. I also finalized (with my mom who'll be there at the same time) our travel plans for that September UK trip: Midhurst, Haslemere, Bletchley Park, Coventry, Newcastle, York, Devon, Midhurst, London. Phew!</p>
<p>I finally walked down the street and got an official Los Angeles County Public Library card.</p>
<p>I bought the domain <a href="http://edtech.wtf">edtech.wtf</a>. I haven&rsquo;t done anything with it yet but was prompted by the new acquisition to do a little work on the <a href="http://techgypsi.es">Tech Gypsies site</a> and on the <a href="/https://github.com/audreywatters">Github repos</a> associated with my annual ed-tech trends posts.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s a minor thing, I realize, but count me in with the folks who are confused, if not disappointed, in the new Foursquare / Swarm app. I have used Foursquare for a really long time as it helps me remember where I&rsquo;ve been and helps me find good restaurants &ndash; those where my friends have been &ndash; when I travel. It seems like it&rsquo;d be pretty easy for me to ditch both apps now and just use Yelp.</p>
<h2>Reading and Listening</h2>
<p>I read <em>Robogenesis</em> (sequel to <em>Robopocalypse</em>). I also read <em>A Measure of Failure: The Political Origins of Standardized Testing</em>.</p>
<p>I thought I was listening to a decent Jimmy Buffett cover band yesterday &ndash; I could hear the music from down on the beach, part of a Discovery Channel Shark Week thing. But oh, hey. It really <em>was</em> Jimmy Buffett.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>My mom and her husband came to visit for a few days. And Kin&rsquo;s sister and a friend came to visit as well. Our Hermosa Beach B&amp;B is in full swing&hellip;</p>
