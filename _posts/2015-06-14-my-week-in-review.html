<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>It hasn&#8217;t been a good week on the family front. My Granny had a heart attack. The kid is here in LA now and had emergency wisdom teeth surgery yesterday.</li>
<li>It was a good week on the friend front, as I got to see lots of folks while I was in Barcelona. It was so great to hang out with Jim Groom, Martin Weller, Sheila MacNeil, Doug Belshaw, and Bryan Mathers.
