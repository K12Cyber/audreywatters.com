<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/beverly-hills-synecdoche">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>While it hasn&rsquo;t risen to quite the furor of the recent round-and-round from Siemens and Downes, I&rsquo;ve been watching Weller and Moe&rsquo;s discussions on the Eddie Murphy analogy with a certain amount of bemused interest. I can&rsquo;t help but read the exchange as a parody of the debates about &ldquo;<a href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2015/05/03/linearity_downes/">what counts</a>&rdquo; as <a href="http://halfanhour.blogspot.com.es/2015/05/the-study-and-other-stuff.html">good MOOC research</a>. It&rsquo;s never good to feed the trolls, I realize, but I do want to weigh in briefly, because even as a joke, I fear it serves to reinforce some of the problems I see with how ed-tech analysis is frequently crafted and shared.</p>
<p>In their posts, Weller and Moe debate whether or not Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s career &ndash; largely dismissed as &ldquo;not very good&rdquo; by both authors &ndash; makes for an appropriate analogy for MOOCs. As Weller writes in the <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/mooc/moocs-as-eddie-murphy/">first post in this series</a>, &ldquo;The &lsquo;stick Murphy in it&rsquo; attitude of studio bosses back in the 80s seems to me rather akin to the &lsquo;stick a MOOC in it&rsquo; attitude I&rsquo;ve encountered with research bids, or discussions around innovative teaching.&rdquo;<a href="http://edutechnicalities.com/film/the-eddie-murphy-mooc-mystery-part-1/"> Moe responds</a> with a quantitative analysis, looking at box office figures and Rotten Tomatoes ratings and comparing Murphy to another former SNL cast member &ndash; one also frequently decried as making bad movies &ndash; Adam Sandler. And <a href="http://blog.edtechie.net/mooc/the-eddie-murphy-cycle/">Weller responds</a>, fine tuning this analysis with a look at IMDb ratings and movie release dates.</p>
<p>So we move from an observation &ndash; Eddie Murphy&rsquo;s career took a downward turn in the 1980s &ndash; to an analogy &ndash; his appearance in a string of bad movies is akin to administrators and entrepreneurs trying to put &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo; in every press release and initiative &ndash; to a measurement framework &ndash; how do we quantify this. Bonus points for including graphs.</p>
<p>But I want to back all the way up to the assumption on which this analysis rests: that Eddie Murphy movies just aren&rsquo;t that good (where &ldquo;good&rdquo; is defined as a blend of box office success and critical reception). I don&rsquo;t think that claim is accurate or, more importantly, relevant. No matter his string of box office flops, I think that Eddie Murphy has remained a cultural icon. His is a star text that should be read &ndash; a reading that must include his work on television, incidentally &ndash; as a counter to traditional portrayals of race, class, and masculinity. He&rsquo;s not the groundbreaking standup comic that Richard Pryor was, to be sure, but Murphy&rsquo;s work is still incredibly subversive, perhaps even more so for his popular success in portraying in the 80s a brash Black male that challenged powerful, racist institutions like police departments and stock markets. Eddie Murphy found success among white viewers &ndash; both moviegoers and SNL fans &ndash; but his comedy did not coddle their feelings.</p>
<p>We cannot talk about Eddie Murphy without talking about race, class, and gender &ndash; in the roles he plays as an actor and in his own star text. Yet, Moe and Weller mention none of these. That&rsquo;s a flaw with too much ed-tech analysis, I&rsquo;d argue, as it scrubs away issues of identity or posits itself as identity-less or objective while actually re-inscribing the position of the white male academic.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s this little box that African-American actors have to work in, in the first place, and I was able to rise above that box.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/eddie-murphy-the-rolling-stone-interview-20111109">interview with <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, 2011</em></p>
<p>Eddie Murphy, like all stars, does not exist in a vacuum. Like all stars &ndash; even those on the list of <a href="http://www.the-numbers.com/people/records/top-grossing-stars-in-all-roles">top grossing actors of all time</a> &ndash; Eddie Murphy is not fully in change of the movies that he appears in. He&rsquo;s not in charge of scripts; he&rsquo;s not in charge of production; he&rsquo;s not in change of the studio system. <em>And Hollywood is a system</em>. We can&rsquo;t really talk about a star without thinking about that system, without situating that system in history, culture, politics, economics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the same thing goes for MOOCs, higher education, and education technology. There are several systems there that are worth considering &ndash; systems that have their own histories, cultures, politics, and economics. I just don&rsquo;t see how Eddie Murphy here is synechdoche, particularly if the analysis focuses on &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and not on race, class, and power.</p>
