<p>Get tattooed.  (Right arm sleeve.  Badgers, lions, clan MacLean, or something.  Something fierce.)</p>

<p>Get a "Techmeme" headline for <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.  Break more news in general.</p>

<p>Deal with all the crap I have -- from what feels like a former lifetime -- in storage.</p>
