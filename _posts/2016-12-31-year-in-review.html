<h3>Most Popular Articles <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/template_research100.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I don&#8217;t know. Who cares? I don&#8217;t have analytics on my sites any longer. I&#8217;d rather not track my readers &#8211; privacy is more important than ego.</p>

<h3>Travel <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/template_travel100.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>

<p>I visited Crater Lake for the first time. I visited Yosemite for the first time. I walked the High Line for the first time. I visited the library at Trinity College for the first time. I visited The Maritimes for the first time.</p>

<h3>Social Media <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_fb.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I rejoined Facebook. </p>

<p>Twitter refused to verify @audreywatters, but did verify @hackeducation. I created two Twitter bots: @redrobotutor and @weaponizedu.</p>

<h3>GitHub Updates <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/template_onlinegamble150.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2016-12-31-github.png"></p>

<p>Yes, thank you &#8220;freelance economy.&#8221; There were only 6 days in 2016 that I did not work.</p>

<h3>Theatre and Concerts and Movies <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_ticket.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I saw <em>The Book of Mormon</em> while in London with the kid. I didn&#8217;t see any live concerts and didn&#8217;t see any movies in the movie theatre. But look. I made over 2600 GitHub contributions.</p>

<h3>Food <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_meal.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>The best meals I ate this year were at Mame (Eugene OR), Rediviva (Aberdeen WA), and Steak and Whiskey (Hermosa Beach CA). I ate Dominican food and Taylor ham for the first time. I gave up drinking coffee. I gave up drinking alcohol for about four months, but damn, this year... I've drowned my sorrows in copious amounts of red wine.</p>

<h3>Tattoos <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_tattoo.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>None. This must be rectified in 2017.</p>

<p>The only body modification this year: dyeing my hair.</p>

<h3>Closure <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/icon_closed.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I finally cleaned out the storage unit that I&#8217;d had in Eugene since my husband died in 2005. My dad&#8217;s estate was finally settled. I paid off my student loans.</p>
