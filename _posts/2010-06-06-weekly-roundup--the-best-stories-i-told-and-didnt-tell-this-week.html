As usual, many of my favorite stories have involved education technologies, a topic that, I'm told by my editor, does not generate a lot of page-views.  But dammit, it generates a lot of satisfaction on my part.  And even though blog titles invoking Al Pacino movies, Lady Gaga videos, or Facebook-as-Illuminati seem wildly popular, I'm going to stick with covering the edtech beat.<p></p>
<strong>The Best Stories I Wrote</strong><p></p>
When Twitter announced in April that it was donating its archives to the Library of Congress, I <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/twitter_archive_is_nothing_without_tools_funding.php">interviewed</a> several digital humanities scholars about their reaction.  Many of these scholars and archivists are involved in <a href="http://www.thatcamp.org">THATCamp</a> and this week, I finally wrote a post about their <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/thatcamp_-_scholars_and_archivists_at_the_intersection_of_computing_and_the_humanities.php">activities</a>.<p></p>
In the lead-up to ReadWriteWeb's <a href="http://www.eventbee.com/view/readwritewebrtw">Real-Time Web Summit</a> next week, I also wrote an <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_real_time_web_k-12_education_-_in_and_out_of_the_classroom.php">article</a> on how educators are using real-time web technologies - in and out of the classroom.  Seeing how teachers use Twitter, Skype, and Google Wave was really inspiring -- a reminder for me about why technology, education and (I'd like to think) technology journalism matters.  I'm very grateful for the generosity of the educators who responded to this (and other) media inquiries about ed tech issues.<p></p>
And speaking of education, I <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/schoolhouse_funk_bootsy_collins_launches_online_ed.php">wrote</a> about Bootsy Collins' Funk University.  Hooray for online education!<p></p>
And hooray for music!  I posted a five-part review of the Sasquatch Music Festival here:  <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=860">Part One</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=868">Part Two</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=874">Part Three</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=883">Part Four</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=893">Part Five</a>.<p></p>
<strong>The Best Stories I Didn't Write</strong><p></p>
I missed a lot of stories.  I mean, I always do, but being out-of-town made it even worse.  When I finally got back online and into the RWW Skype Chat room and asked, "What did I miss?" the answer was "The Internet."  And that pretty much sums it up.<p></p>
I didn't get a chance to write about the addition of a "search" feature to <a href="http://www.drewolanoff.com/">Drew</a>'s <a href="http://qwotebook.com">Qwotebook</a> site.  When I <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/05/the-importance-of-inspiration-drew-olanoffs-qwotebook-goes-live.php">reviewed</a> Qwotebook, I said "search would be nice," and not only did Drew say my piece was <a href="http://blog.qwotebook.com/post/647125782/the-search-for-truth">awesome</a>, he added search.  Whoa!  And while I could, I suppose, wax poetic about the power of the technoblogger, I'd rather point to the power of kicking cancer's ass and the power the Twitter hashtag (#<a href="http://blamecancer.com/">blamecancer</a>).  And I'd like to give Drew a big loving shout-out for having the wildest, most triumphant <a href="http://www.drewolanoff.com/post/663655315/this-time-im-gonna-get-it-right">year</a> and wish him many, many more.<p></p>
There are a number of other things I just didn't get around to writing about this week, and some of these stories will appear -- I hope -- on my new edtech-focused blog <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.  Some stories will appear here.  Some stories, as usual, will appear "elsewhere," and that "elsewhere" now includes two new venues:  RWW's <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud">cloud computing channel</a> and <a href="http://istelearning.org/">ISTE Learning</a>.<p></p>
(Because as Drew knows, once you come back from dealing with cancer, you come back with a motherfucking vengeance!)<p></p>
