<p>Isaiah needed help with some homework tonight. Or rather, Isaiah had homework to do this weekend, and he waited til tonight to do it. He had to write an essay -- an exercise that always flusters him -- and so he wanted my help.</p>
<p>Isaiah and I really couldn't be more different when it comes to school. I loved academics; I thrived doing it. Isaiah loathes school. He always has.</p>
<p>Isaiah's assignment was to write about his best and his worst experiences in school. What the hell sort of essay is that?! (Narrative, I guess...) Where's the analysis? The interpretation? The argument?</p>
<p>I often rail against his writing assignments, as I've taught college composition enough to see the problem when you fail to equip students with the skills to write good essays.</p>
<p>Of course, Isaiah's not really doing college preparatory work. He's in an alternative program, where hopefully he can at least get his diploma. So I guess I should relax my outcry against the "five paragraph special," as I like to call the form for most high school essays (Introduction- Idea 1 - Idea 2 - Idea 3 - Conclusion that rephrases Introduction).</p>
<p>As Isaiah and I worked through the assignment, it was interesting to hear him pick out a best and a worst moment. They weren't what I'd expected (worst moment: his 7th birthday when I brought ice cream cups as treats for his 2nd grade class and by the time he'd handed them all out, there were no more of the flavor he wanted. Devastating!!)</p>
<p>It's hard to watch Isaiah struggle with his writing, and I can't help but think that better topics -- something he can really sink some analytical teeth into -- would actually be easier than the inane topic he was assigned. Even if Isaiah and his school-mates aren't college-bound, there's no reason not to foster their critical thinking skills.</p>
