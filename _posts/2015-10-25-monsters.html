<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/the-revenge-of-the-monsters-of-education-technology-forthcoming">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>(I think) I&rsquo;m done with speaking engagements for the year. As I did last year, I&rsquo;m going to publish my talks as a book. And as it&rsquo;s a follow-up to last year&rsquo;s book, I&rsquo;m calling it <em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em>.</p>
<p>I plan to spend the next few weeks editing the chapters. I&rsquo;m also going to record audio for it and for <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em>. The audio version(s) will be bundled with the electronic version. I will make copies available in a variety of formats on my site, but will sell them via Gumroad (and possibly other platforms).</p>
<p>I still need to decide the sub-sections and the order of the chapters. I still need to write an introduction and a conclusion. But my goal is to have this ready to hit "publish" by the end of November &ndash; just in time to begin work on my &ldquo;Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015&rdquo; series.</p>
<p>Here are the chapters (so far):</p>
<ol>
<li>The Algorithmic Future of Education</li>
<li>Technology Imperialism, the Californian Ideology, and the Future of Higher Education</li>
<li>Existing Digitally</li>
<li>And So, Without Ed-Tech Criticism&hellip;</li>
<li>Teaching Machines and Turing Machines: The History of the Future of Labor and Learning</li>
<li>Is It Time to Give Up on Computers in Schools?</li>
<li>Learning Networks, Not Teaching Machines</li>
<li>The Golden Lasso of Education Technology</li>
<li>Ed-Tech&rsquo;s Inequalities</li>
<li>Men (Still) Explain Technology to Me: Gender and Education Technology</li>
<li>The History of the Future of Education</li>
</ol>
