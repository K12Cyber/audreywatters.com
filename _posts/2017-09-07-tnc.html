<p>We had a substitute teacher last night for the first session of our seminar on Opinion Writing. Professor Jelani Cobb couldn&rsquo;t make it, so he sent his friend Ta-Nehisi Coates.</p>
<p>I should have taken notes. Instead I sat there starstruck as TNC graciously answered the class&rsquo;s questions on writing. Those questions were wide-ranging: how long does it take him to write a book; what&rsquo;s that process like; where do his ideas come from; how has celebrity changed how he works; how does he choose his subject matter; and so on.</p>
<p>Strangely, being in the room with such greatness helped me feel better about my own position as an opinion writer. I&rsquo;ve been really feeling anxious about my fellowship, feeling like I don&rsquo;t belong at this prestigious J School. I signed up to for Jelani Cobb&rsquo;s class on opinion writing &ndash; even though that&rsquo;s largely what I do for a living already &ndash; because, while many of the other Spencer Fellows sit in on education classes, I felt like I needed to do much more to hone my craft in journalism itself. I&rsquo;m not a journalist by training, after all.</p>
<p>I do have plenty of ideas and plenty of opinions. But turning those into long form isn&rsquo;t so easy. And frankly, sometimes I feel guilty that I don&rsquo;t have &ldquo;takes&rdquo; on everything that happens in ed-tech, even though I certainly have thoughts on all of it.</p>
<p>TNC talked a bit with us about the difference between opinions of the sort you toss out in conversations with friends &ndash; on- or offline &ndash; and those that you develop into an article. He talked too about how he writes in anger &ndash; I can relate &ndash; but how he doesn&rsquo;t feel compelled to weigh in with a knee-jerk response but rather builds on that anger until there&rsquo;s a deeper, richer, more powerful argument. (He&rsquo;s out today with a new article &ldquo;<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/">The First White President</a>&rdquo; that really exemplifies this.) There&rsquo;s a difference between the kind of opinion you tweet, he told us, and the kind of opinion that&rsquo;s worthy of building out into an opinion piece.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the demands not just of social media but, more structurally, of the job of an &ldquo;op-ed writer&rdquo; (particularly those columnists at The NYT &ndash; you know who I mean) that almost requires people write silly stuff. When you&rsquo;ve got to come up with two opinion pieces a week, there&rsquo;s no time for research, no time for contemplation, no time for much more than a very routine and empty 800 words. A waste of time, and TNC insists that he never wants to waste anyone&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to waste my own time this year. It&rsquo;s a huge privilege to have 9 months to think and to write and to not have to worry about my usual hustle. After last night, I&rsquo;m feeling more confident I can do this, and I&rsquo;m feeling less pressured to just publish because the Web demands more &ldquo;content.&rdquo;</p>
