<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m now set up on <a href="https://keybase.io/audreywatters">keybase.io</a>, which among other things provides a PGP key with which to contact me.</li>
<li>I started a site in the new DS106 Tilde Club: [ds106.club/<sub>audreywatters/](http://ds106.club/</sub>audreywatters/)</li>
<li>I finished my article about the history (histories) of MOOCs for the forthcoming <em>World of Learning</em> essay collection.</li>
<li>Bryan Alexander and I were the guest speakers in an Educause webinar on this year&#8217;s Horizon Report.</li>
<li>I unfollowed over 1000 accounts on Twitter this week, and I&#8217;ve removed the app from my computer. I&#8217;ve still got it on my phone, and I&#8217;ll check in from time to time. But I&#8217;m going to start using Known to post status updates. And I&#8217;m not going to pay as close attention to the stream as I have been. It&#8217;s just not worth it.</li>
<li>So yes, I&#8217;ve finally set up <a href="http://audrey.techgypsi.es">Known</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I watched <em>The Imitation Game</em>, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy it much.</li>
<li>Kin and I are battling for who gets to read our copy of Bruce Schneier&#8217;s new book <em>Data and Goliath</em> (So far he's winning. And that's okay as I have to finish <em>The War on Learning</em>, as I have a book review due - oh crap - Wednesday.</li>
</ul>
