<li>I didn&#8217;t write anything on the Teaching Machines&#8217; blog this week, I now realize. Ooops. I am still going through the photos and notes I took at ETS. I&#8217;m also reading a bunch of books and articles about programmed instruction and trying to figure out how to turn academic research from the 1960s into a page-turning narrative</li>

<h3>Working <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_project.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I did some of the usual &#8220;end-of-the-month&#8221; tasks like backing up my files, deleting old Tweets, and updating my CV</li>
<li>I recorded some audio with Nathan Maton about technology and ethics</li>
<li>As &#8220;The Break&#8221; notes above, I have started a break away from social media until the book is written. I will probably write a bit on the blog this week about how I&#8217;m doing this and how it&#8217;s going. I&#8217;m only one day in, after all.</li>

<h3>Reading and Listening <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2018_icon_bookmark.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I finished reading <em>Programed Instruction</em> and I am re-reading <em>The Cult of Information</em></li>
<li>I finished listening to <em>I Contain Multitudes</em> and I am listening to <em>Fear Itself</em></li>
</ul>
