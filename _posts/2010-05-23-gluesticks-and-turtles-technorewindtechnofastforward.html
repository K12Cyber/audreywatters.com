Of course, I've screwed it up already as he clearly stipulated "no digital presence" and I've just gone and blogged about the thing.  Dammit.<p></p>
But it's not just the excitement with the thought of opening up that manilla envelope of mine, full of newspaper clippings and images and eminently Xerox-able graphics, that has me thinking about old skool technology.<p></p>
I started thinking today about <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/Logo-foundation/index.html">Logo</a>, a programming language that was designed in the late Sixties, in part, as an educational tool for teaching programming.  I'm not sure why I've had Logo on the brain.<p></p>

Perhaps my subconsciousness telling me I should learn programming.<p></p>
Perhaps my internal clock shifting into the <a href="http://center.uoregon.edu/ISTE/2010/">pre-NECC</a> frenzy - even though I'm not going/not worried this year.<p></p>
Perhaps it's that I'm worried that I desperately need a new computer, and the choosing the lesser of evils - Windows or Apple - leaves a bitter taste in my mouth.  (And yes, I know there are alternatives.  Please note the folklore and literature  background, mmkay?)<p></p>
Since chatting with <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2010/05/kim-polese-receives-ncwit-symo.php" target="_blank">Kim Polese</a> on Thursday evening, I've been thinking a lot about how girls - smart girls, dare I say - get pressured to put down our schoolbooks and/or get pressed down certain avenues of study. (Don't get me wrong.  Folklore pwns the shit out of math every day. I'm just sayin'.)<p></p>
Smart girls rock, of course, whether they study biology, Märchen, eigthteenth-century French poetry, or astrophysics. But whether it's girls or boys engaged in techno-mathy-engineering-wut-wut, I still worry that we are really dropping the ball with how we prepare kids for the future.<p></p>
I know a bunch of amazing educators who are hard at work teaching critical thinking, analysis,and, o yes, programming. But I still see us cultivating a nation of tech consumers more so than a nation of tech innovators (to be clear, I am not blaming teachers here). There are a lot of reasons, of course, but it seems like we prioritize neither science nor creativity. Surely we can do better than gluesticks and<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/Logo-foundation/logo/turtle.html" target="_blank">Turtle</a>, But hell, that's a start.
