<p>This isn&rsquo;t a list post. I hate them. I hate seeing them scroll by in my Twitter feed. I hate seeing folks retweet them. I hate writing them. I hate a blogging industry that encourages writers to produce them.</p>

<p><br />I hate the phoniness of their numerical significance. I hate the facade of "the top."</p>
<p>Most list posts don&rsquo;t explain why things are &ldquo;the best.&rdquo; Instead it&rsquo;s just a list &mdash; a linkable, likable piece of blog-bait.</p>
<p>Top 10 things that came up when I did a Google search. Top 10 reasons to click on this post. Top 10 reasons to retweet it. Top 10 reasons to share this on your Facebook profile. Top 10 reasons why a blog rocks at SEO. Top 10 reasons why readers suck at Web and media literacy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s particularly painful to see the proliferation of these posts by education blogs.</p>

<p><br />I&rsquo;ve complained about this on Twitter before, and some teachers have responded that they love having lists of resources to choose from. But that&rsquo;s a bit like saying you love the phone book because it gives you a long list of people you might call. A directory is great, don&rsquo;t get me wrong.

<p><br />It&rsquo;s been over a year and a half since Dan Meyer wrote &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?p=9672">Stop Linking to &lsquo;Top 100 Blog&rsquo; Lists</a>,&rdquo; explaining how for-profit schools and for-profit-portals-capitalizing-on-for-profit-schools use these posts to boost their search engine rankings. Dan&rsquo;s post is as relevant today as ever.</p>
