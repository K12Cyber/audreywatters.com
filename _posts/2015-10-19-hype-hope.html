<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/hype-and-hope-thoughts-on-my-icde-workshop">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>The last couple of workshops that I've given have been fairly technical &ndash; GitHub for Beginners sort of thing. But I wasn&rsquo;t sure how technical I could or should be for the ICDE crowd. Plus the title I&rsquo;d been assigned was &ldquo;The History of Education Technology: Hype or Hope.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not a particularly workshop-y title, so I was pretty stumped about what to say. And that was compounded by the fact that I had no idea who the participants would be or what they&rsquo;d want to do.</p>
<p>I made some slides &ndash; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tjsvjl1jg1j1jom/icde2015workshop.pdf?dl=0">available here</a> &ndash; but mostly winged it.</p>
<p>The room was small with four circular tables, so I decided small group discussion was the way to go. Most of those in the workshop &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t get a headcount, but I&rsquo;m guessing 30&ndash;35 participants &ndash; were from the global South.</p>
<p>I asked the groups to talk about which education technologies they thought were the most hyped (and in which they had the most hope). And I am only jotting down these notes here so that I remember their response, because I think it was quite revealing:</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, the room agreed that <strong>mobile learning</strong> was the most hyped ed-tech.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about all the VCs and (ed-) tech entrepreneurs I&rsquo;ve seen hold up their smartphone and extol the coming &ldquo;mobile (learning) revolution&rdquo;: &ldquo;everyone has a cellphone now.&rdquo; Well, no. Not everyone. And even when they do, those phones do not necessarily have Internet access. And even when phones have data plans, that still doesn&rsquo;t mean that mobile learning is adequate or sufficient or a &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; or even a good idea.</p>
<p>It was fascinating to hear about African educators&rsquo; response to the hype about mobile learning: the challenges of reading educational materials on a phone, for example; the challenges of watching educational videos (either streaming or downloaded), the lack of experience using technologies for school and not merely for entertainment. Some of these concerns are common everywhere, I reckon. I think what struck me was that saying mobile learning was &ldquo;the most hyped&rdquo; really got to the core of some of the problems with ed-tech&rsquo;s promises. I mean, MOOCs and OER were mentioned in the group discussions too &ndash; but these all fall under (into?) this larger category of mobile learning, I&rsquo;d argue.</p>
<p>So fundamentally, I think, ed-tech remains overhyped &ndash; from the specific to the general.</p>
