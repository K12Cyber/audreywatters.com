<p><em>And we're off. Next week begins the whirlwind of speaking and traveling for Kin and me. Here's a look at our calendar:</em></p>
<p><strong>January 24: Philadelphia</strong></p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.oclc.org/en-US/events/2014/ARCMeetingSymposium_ALAMW2014.html">The Hype and Hope of MOOCs</a>" - I'm speaking on a panel with Bryan Alexander, Anya Kamenetz, and Ray Schroeder. This event is part of the OCLC Symposium. And I'll tell you this right now: I'm more bullish on libraries than I am on our current version of MOOCs. I'm also pretty stoked to meet my fellow panelists, all of whom I admire greatly, none of whom I've met offline before.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://educonphilly.org/schedule/Openness-Should_We_Create_a_More_Transparent_World">Openness: Should We Create a More Transparent World?</a>" - Kin is part of the evening panel that opens Educon. He'll be accompanied by the kickass Jaime Casap, David Wiley, Sunny Lee, and&nbsp;Homa Tavangar.</p>
<p><strong>January 26: Philadelphia</strong></p>
<p>"<a href="http://educonphilly.org/conversations/The_Privileged_Voices_in_Education">The Privileged Voices in Education</a>" - So this is gonna be fun. Jose Vilson and I are going to facilitate a discussion about privilege at Educon. I really can't think of a more important conversation to have right now. Well, others probably could make a list of important conversations and have this topic nowhere on it. (That's partially our point.)</p>
<p><strong>January 27-29: Washington DC</strong></p>
<p>Kin and I are going to be in DC for a few days to wrap up things from our ill-fated "relocation" there this fall. Shoot me an email, DC people, if I owe you a drink.</p>
<p><strong>January 30: Atlanta</strong></p>
<p>(Title TBA, but it's going to be something like "Dammit, We Need to Take Control Of Our Digitalia and We're Assholes if We Don't Help Students Do the Same"): I'm giving the keynote at <a href="http://ewprogram.com/incubator/">Emory University's Domain Incubator</a>, an event that's bringing together folks to talk about how to build out and support "Domain of One's Own"-like initiatives on campuses beyond the (awesome) University of Mary Washington. I plan to talk about the NSA and Google and data and politics and privilege, I think. I'm also facilitating a panel at this event on "Open Learning" with the wonderful Jesse Stommel. Also while I'm in Atlanta, Tressie McMillan Cottom and I are going to get stupid drunk together. You've been warned.</p>
<p><strong>February 4: San Diego</strong></p>
<p>"<a href="http://ipadsummitusa.org/san-diego/">The History of the Future of Ed-Tech</a>": I'm totally stealing the idea behind <a href="http://vimeo.com/71278954">Bret Victor's keynote</a> at DBX last year to talk at the EdTechTeacher iPad Summit about the history of ed-tech and predictions from the 60s and 70s and 80s about ed-tech's future.</p>
<p>"Terms of Service 101: Who Owns Student Data": I'm also giving a workshop at the EdTechTeacher iPad Summit about <a href="http://tosdr.org/">Terms of Service</a> and student privacy.</p>
<p><em>And that's it 'til March, folks! Well, except for the huge announcement that I'll be making in the next week or so about an amazing new project I'm working on. But that's it for my speaking engagements...</em></p>
