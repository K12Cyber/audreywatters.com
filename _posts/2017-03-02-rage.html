<p>I'm from a red state, from a red family, tho I know my politics deviated early. So I'm used to different politics and visions for the future.</p>
<p>But right now I am so angry and so disappointed and so disgusted in every single person I know -- including many I love -- for voting for <span class="_5mfr _47e3"><span class="_7oe">üçä</span></span><span class="_5mfr _47e3"><span class="_7oe">üëπ</span></span> I don't even know how to proceed with you.</p>
<p>(Most of you have blocked me on FB. That's how *you* proceed.)</p>
<p>I see the white nationalist hatred that <span class="_5mfr _47e3"><span class="_7oe">üçä</span></span><span class="_5mfr _47e3"><span class="_7oe">üëπ</span></span> has unleashed and that you've sanctioned, and I'm not sure how I will ever forgive you. How can I ever sit with you and not talk about this? How can I ever break bread with you if I'm supposed to be silent?</p>
<p>This I know:</p>
<p>I will be here for your children -- your queer kids and your trans kids and your immigrant kids and your brown kids and your alter-abled kids and your adopted kids and your daughters and and all those whose worlds you want to foreclose because *they're* curious and *you're* a small-minded, fearful asshole...</p>
