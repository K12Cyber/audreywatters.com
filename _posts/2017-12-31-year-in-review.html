<h3>Spencer Fellowship!!! <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/template_lion.png" height="42" width="42" align="right" style="margin:10px"></h3>
<br />
<p>I still can&#8217;t believe it, to be perfectly honest. I was selected as a Spencer Education Fellow at the Columbia School of Journalism for the 2017&#8211;18 academic year. It&#8217;s meant a huge shift for Kin and me. We left beautiful Hermosa Beach and relocated to New York, initially thinking we&#8217;d just stay here for the duration of the fellowship, but changing our mind once we got to the Upper West Side. We&#8217;ve rented an apartment here, and even though there&#8217;s snow outside as I type this, we&#8217;ll be staying for a while.</p>

<p>I feel as though I&#8217;ve spent the first few months of my fellowship just adjusting to life here. (Moving was a bigger ordeal than I imagined.) People ask how my project is coming, and I politely change the subject.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I did a lot of work this summer on that project &#8211; researching some of the financial, political, and social networks of education&#8217;s investors and entrepreneurs. See: <a href="http://network.hackeducation.com">network.hackeducation.com</a>. I have some reporting trips planned for the spring, and I&#8217;ll be working on how best to visualize these networks. </p>

<p>But in the spring, I&#8217;ll also be taking Sam Freedman&#8217;s book-writing class. Perhaps in 2018 I will actually finish <em>Teaching Machines</em>. (No. Not &#8220;perhaps.&#8221; <em>I will</em>.)</p>

<p>The highlight of the fellowship so far: we had a substitute teacher the first night of Jelani Cobb&#8217;s class on opinion writing. (And I should clarify: taking that class was also a highlight. Just not <em>the</em> highlight.) I wasn&#8217;t formally registered for the class, so I had no idea what was going on on that first night. But as we waited for class to start, the other students started murmuring: &#8220;Jelani can&#8217;t make it.&#8221; &#8220;Oh my god.&#8221; &#8220;Oh my god.&#8221; And at 6pm, his stand-in entered: his friend, Ta-Nehisi Coates. We spent the next hour or so just talking with TNC about how he works, how his work has changed, what constitutes an opinion worth writing about (and what is, in his words, just the sort of opinion you express at the bar). We all had to introduce ourselves and when I said &#8220;I&#8217;m Audrey, and I&#8217;m a Spencer Fellow,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; And someone else in the class sneered &#8220;She gets $75,000 to just do what she wants for a year.&#8221; (This is a common description of the fellowship. I ain&#8217;t mad.) And Ta-Nehisi looked at me and said &#8220;That&#8217;s huge. Congratulations.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is huge. I get to sit and think and write and research and I don&#8217;t have to hustle for these 9 months for my next freelance check or speaking gig. It&#8217;s a different hustle. I gotta get stuff written, and I gotta make connections, and if I want to be able to make this New York thing work, I gotta work a lot. </p>

<p>But here I am, at the end of a terrible year, really really pleased about where my work is at.</p>
