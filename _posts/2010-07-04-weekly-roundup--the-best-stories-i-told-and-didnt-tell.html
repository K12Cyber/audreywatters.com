As such, I'm struggling to come up with a list of the "best" stories I told this week.  I am quite fond of the "<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/06/30/20-lessons-learned/">20 'Lessons Learned' Posts You'll Never Learn From Me</a>," but I tend to find myself wildly more amusing than others do.<p></p>
Looking back on what knocked me into a funk following such a <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/06/27/weekly-roundup/">kick-ass week</a>, I'd say it was a combination of my own insecurities and perfectionism, helped in no small part by the anti-adoration of blog commenters and the empty-headed egotism I saw blogged elsewhere.  "Ignore it" and "Get over it" was the advice I heard.  But as I don't blog in a vacuum, I think a writer's attention to audience and to context is pretty important -- almost as important as a writer's attention to the text itself.  <p></p>
In addition, the end-of-the-month forced another reflection, of sorts, as I had to itemize and invoice for my freelance work for June, making me reassess how I spend my writing and researching energies.  <p></p>
That being said, I've got some great stories in the works, as well as a strategy to make sure when I do, in fact, tell a good one that I do a better job with its syndication.  Hopefully, I can channel this past week's super-pissed-off energy into some super-smart writing.
