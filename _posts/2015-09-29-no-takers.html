<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/no-takers">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>A friend of mine just wrapped up a stint as an op-ed writer for a major publication. She&rsquo;s relieved, she says, to not have to come up with an opinion-a-week. (It was not just a matter of coming up with an opinion &ndash; it was coming up with one that editors liked, thought timely and clickworthy, and wanted to publish.)</p>
<p>The pressure to write &ldquo;hot takes&rdquo; is ridiculous, and often online writers are expected to churn them out quite rapidly, not just regularly. You&rsquo;re supposed to response to the latest Internet outrage (or virality, I suppose) of the day. And there&rsquo;s little time to sit and stew and to figure out what your &ldquo;take&rdquo; might be. It has to be served fresh.</p>
<p>(Or, alternately, it can simply be served &ldquo;dumb.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d characterize David Brooks&rsquo; columns, for example. Wouldn&rsquo;t you?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thought a lot lately about changes I want to (need to) make to my work life, in part because of [redacted financial expense]. So some days, I want to write more freelance pieces and travel less. But then again, I really enjoy the types of written pieces that I compose as keynotes. And jesus, I&rsquo;ve got to finish <em>Teaching Machines</em>.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve thought about pursuing a position as an op-ed writer somewhere. (&ldquo;Contributor&rdquo; or whatever.) <strong>Got any leads?</strong></p>
<p>But I do worry about having to have a &ldquo;hot take&rdquo; regularly. I mean, I have opinions all the fucking time. But I worry about having to craft that into an interesting argument to the drumbeat of an editorial calendar. I see so much lousy content online that obviously serves just this: it met the deadline. It met the word count. But it said nothing.</p>
<p>Perhaps this all just reflects some of my feelings of self-doubt lately &ndash; that I&rsquo;m not really up-to-snuff when it comes to being a writer. (This is, of course, one of the benefits of speaking. You get immediate encouragement and typically pretty friendly responses from people face-to-face. The Internet, on the other hand, is full of assholes.)</p>
<p>Or perhaps it reflects the in-between-ness of my work: it&rsquo;s not academic; it&rsquo;s not pop. It&rsquo;s grounded in research, but it&rsquo;s full of opinion. It&rsquo;s specialist, but a specialty with limited appeal (particularly when you&rsquo;re critical of the field).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on Hack Education for five years now. It&rsquo;s the longest I&rsquo;ve worked at one &ldquo;job&rdquo; in my life. (Grad school doesn&rsquo;t count, does it?) Maybe it&rsquo;s time for something different? (Fortunately I have two ideas for a &ldquo;what&rsquo;s next&rdquo; book-wise &ndash; neither project deals directly with ed-tech. What a relief.)</p>
