<p>Even if Democrats lose this vote &ndash; and it&rsquo;s likely they will &ndash; I hope that they have learned a lesson with Betsy DeVos: people care about education. It doesn&rsquo;t always figure into debates. It doesn&rsquo;t always poll as well as &ldquo;the economy&rdquo; or &ldquo;national security.&rdquo; But people care. Public education matters. It matters on a personal level that white, middle class folks in particular relate to. (This, to my mind, explains why people are so enraged about DeVos&rsquo;s nomination but not about other possible Cabinet members.)</p>
<p>The Democrats have not done much to distinguish themselves from Republicans when it comes to education policy in recent years. Obama&rsquo;s education legacy is much the same as Bush&rsquo;s which was much the same as Clinton&rsquo;s. (Perhaps going after for-profit higher education &ndash; a centerpiece of the Obama higher ed policy &ndash; was a notable exception.)</p>
<p>Can Democrats recenter themselves so that they are committed to communities, to equity, to justice, to democratic education? That&rsquo;s their path forward to win. Not some embrace of punitive charter school education or surveillance-oriented ed-tech.</p>
