You should have known when I decided to write about <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/08/28/morphology-of-a-tech-startup-folktale/">Russian Formalism</a> and <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/08/11/p-np-for-non-math-majors/">theoretical computer science</a> -- that it was a sign there were things that I was furiously trying not to talk about.  <p></p>
I mean, it's August, right?  This is the month that reminds me that <a href="http://badbadbadger.blogspot.com/2005/08/not-worst-day-of-my-life.html">things fall apart</a>.<p></p>
Except not this year.  This year, things are falling together.  And it makes August difficult in a different way, perhaps, and I'm not quite sure what to write about that.<p></p>
I have all these scraps and snippets, ideas jotted down and scribbled out, half-drafted blog posts.  I have a lot of things I want to say, things I should say, things I probably shouldn't.  But mostly I have a jumble of fucked-up thoughts and sentiments that make it very difficult to write clearly or write well about the impending date:  <p></p>
<i><center><b>August 29.  The five year anniversary of Anthony's death.</i></center></b><p></p>

"Time flies" is one cliche.  "Time heals" is another.<p></p>
I can't believe how much my life changed, from his cancer diagnosis to his death.  I can't believe how much my life has changed since then.  I can't believe the trajectory my life is on right now.<p></p>
I spend my days writing now, which may be part of the reason why I'm having such a hard time extricating the blogging from the dying and the surviving and the thriving, why I've had such a wicked case of writer's block here on this blog during the month of August.  I was meant to write, I don't doubt that one bit.  And it was Anthony's diagnosis that prompted me to start a blog.  It was writing that kept me sane as I chronicled all this.  It was writing that helped me sort through my thoughts, my emotions.  It was blogging that brought me into online communities that gave -- and still give -- me a ton of support.<p></p>
I still use writing to work through my ideas, my emotions.  And while the perfectionist in me is loathe to publish things that haven't been fully fleshed out, I think today, I will do just that, recognizing that yes, it has been five years and yes, I still find myself thinking abou death and dying without any answers, without much wisdom, without the right words.
