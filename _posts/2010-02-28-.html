<div><a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201002trees.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-936" title="trees" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201002trees.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Last night was the moment I've waited for for ten years, the chance to put my arms around my friend <a href="http://freefreenow.org/" target="_blank">Jeffrey "Free" Luers</a> and give him a long, hard hug. And another. And another. And a kiss on the cheek. And another hug. I thought my heart would explode with joy. <strong>The End</strong>.<p></p>
But after attending the <a href="http://www.pielc.org/pages/home.html" target="_blank">Public Interest Environmental Law Conference</a> (aka ELAW) for the first time in six years this weekend, after hearing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE" target="_blank">Ramona Africa</a> and Jeff speak, after seeing fellow activists I haven't seen in a decade, it's also very much <strong>The Beginning</strong>.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jan_hoogendoorn/2407703779/"></a>I won't lie. Anthony's cancer and his death almost extinguished my fire. But in addition to that profoundly personal trauma were a myriad of other losses from the last decade: Bush, war, arrests, arrests, arrests, fear, in-fighting, and the collapse/implosion/suppression of much of the local radical resistance.<p></p>
Anthony is gone.  But so are others. Imprisoned. In hiding. Burned out. Dead. Gone.<p></p>
When Ramona shouted "Long live Jeff Luers. Long live Mumia Abu-Jamal. Long live Leonard Peltier. Long live the Zapatistas. ... and down with this rotten ass system," I felt the winds whip up that tiny spark I've managed to keep burning, and I know what I have to do now to care for and nourish that flame. I have to write. I have to agitate. I have to fight.<p></p>
Because, yes, we have lost a lot over the past decade. A lot of folks are gone. But as my friend Shelley said last night, "Sometimes, we get them back." We have Free back. And we still have a world to fight for.<p></p>
