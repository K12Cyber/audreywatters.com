<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<p>Nope. (Kin is on the road though.) Upcoming week: Philadelphia. And so the 2015 travel season begins.</p>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I hammered out more words on <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>, but I didn&#8217;t hit my writing target for the week. Dammit.</li>
<li>Mike Caulfield and I talked about our plans to hold a &#8220;FedWiki Happening&#8221; on teaching machines. More information <a href="http://hapgood.us/2015/01/16/a-fedwiki-happening-on-teaching-machines-featuring-audrey-watters/">here</a>.</li>
<li>I had a chat with Tiffany Reiss about her startup <a href="http://www.thehubedu.com/">TheHubEdu</a>.</li>
<li>Tressie McMillan Cottom and I started a Google Doc for an article we&#8217;re working on. (The first step is always &#8220;start a Google Doc.&#8221;)</li>
<li><a href="http://ai2020.com/011">The EPT podcast</a> I recorded with Adnan Iftekhar is now available.</li>
<li>I had a wonderful email exchange with Paul Breedlove, one of the creators of the Speak &amp; Spell.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I watched the Ducks lose the college football championship game. Bummer, I guess.</li>
<li>I watched <em>Gone Girl</em>. (Hated it.)</li>
<li>I finished reading <em>The Marvelous Land of Oz</em>, and I started reading <em>Ozma of Oz</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Friends and Family</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve had a friend of Kin&#8217;s visiting this week.</li> 
<li>I&#8217;ve sent a lot of encouraging messages to the kid, who&#8217;s decidedly not-thrilled to be back in school.</li>
</ul>
