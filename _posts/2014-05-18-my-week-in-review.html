<p><em>I&rsquo;m stealing a page from my friend Doug Belshaw's playbook. He does a great job cataloging what he&rsquo;s done and what he&rsquo;s read and what he&rsquo;s learned each week. To that end, he sends out a <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/newsletter/">weekly newsletter</a> (ed-tech folks should subscribe as Doug's work at Mozilla means there are always interesting thoughts re: teaching and learning and webmaking and open source-ness). Me, I already generate too many newsletters, so instead I&rsquo;m going to blog the updates here.</em></p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin</a> and I traveled to Kamloops, British Columbia on Tuesday &ndash; a first time to Kamloops for both of us. I was the keynote Wednesday morning at <a href="http://www.tru.ca/distance/cnie.html">CNIE 2014</a>. (I&rsquo;ve posted the notes and slides from my talk <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/05/14/innovation-cnie-2014/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>It was a great trip, made even more awesome thanks to the lake-side food and music and beers with the likes of Brian Lamb, Grant Potter, Jason Toal, Irwin DeVries, Giulia Forsythe, and D&rsquo;Arcy Norman. (Some of the sounds were captured and posted to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kinlane">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;if you missed the <a href="http://ds106rad.io/listen/">DS106 radio livestream</a>.)</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/audrey-singing.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>It was back to Los Angeles on Friday, where apparently we missed a heat wave while we were gone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The upcoming week&rsquo;s travel destination</span>: For me, Edmonton, Alberta (I almost bought an LA Kings t-shirt to wear during my keynote but decided it&rsquo;s already dicey enough crossing the border into Canada these days.)</p>
<h2>Hack Education Writings and Not-Writings</h2>
<p>It feels like <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a> has become a site that posts mostly weekly edu news roundups and keynote talks. Apologies. Between the book-writing and the traveling and the speaking, it is what it is. Here&rsquo;s what I wrote there this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/05/14/innovation-cnie-2014/">Against &ldquo;Innovation&rdquo;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/05/17/hack-education-weekly-news-5-17-2014/">Hack Education Weekly News: MOOC Magic! MOOC Disruption!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters/letters/hack-education-weekly-newsletter-no-60">Hack Education Weekly Newsletter, No. 60</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I did not post the notes from my once-again canceled presentation to the good folks, the patient folks over at the <a href="https://www.bigmarker.com/communities/GlobalMathDept/about">Global Math Department</a>. And unlike most online writers this week, I did not weigh in with "think pieces" on Solange versus Jay-Z or on Jill Abramson's ouster from The NYT.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<h2>Editing Educating Modern Learners</h2>
<p>The theme this week over on <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a> (where I am editor and lead writer) was leadership and community, with articles by Zac Chase (<a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-is-net-neutrality-and-why-should-educators-care-that-its-in-danger/">on net neutrality</a>) and Jabiz Raisdana (<a href="http://modernlearners.com/digital-storytelling-and-online-learning-networks/">on DS106</a> in a K&ndash;12 environment), as well as a <a href="http://modernlearners.com/critical-conversations-podcast-mike-mcgill/">podcast-interview</a> between Will Richardson and Mike McGill. (Some of these articles are behind the EML paywall, but even free subscribers can receive 2 weekly newsletters &ndash; see I warned you about the newsletters &ndash; as well as access to my regular column "What You Should Know This Week.")</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What You Should Know This Week</span>: <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-7/">EU Court Backs the &ldquo;Right to Be Forgotten&rdquo; Online</a></p>
<h2>Reading and Listening and Crowd-funding</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through Thomas Piketty&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067443000X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=067443000X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkId=7LH5HBVYTT3IULQN">Capital in the Twenty-First Century</a></em>. No doubt all the talk of growing economic inequality (thanks not just to Piketty, of course) is permeating my thinking, writing, speaking.</p>
<p>I bought the new Black Keys album <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J80VVLA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00J80VVLA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hackeduc-20&amp;linkId=VKYOOTURPI7TH4US">Turn Blue</a></em>, which much like the Black Keys themselves is solidly predictable (and predictably not-great-but-okay).</p>
<p>I backed a couple of crowd-funding campaigns this week: one for <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/inbloom-data-politics-money-education-and-the-crash">Bill Fitzgerald&rsquo;s book project on inBloom, data, and education reform</a> and one for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stevealtes/geeks-and-greeks-an-epic-graphic-novel-about-mit-p">Steve Altes&rsquo; graphic novel on MIT pranks</a>. I also chipped in for <a href="http://therumpus.net/2014/05/eden-alexander-crowd-funding-and-discrimination-against-sex-workers/">Eden Alexander&rsquo;s medical bills</a>.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>I purchased a one-way plane ticket for the kid, who&rsquo;s leaving Portland on Monday to come and stay with us in LA for a while.</p>
<p>Siva Vaidhyanathan asked what message he should give the UVA Media Studies Class of 2014, and I said &ldquo;Be nicer to your parents. Chances are you&rsquo;ll move back in with them soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be nicer to your parents. Be nicer to your kids. Be nicer to your Granny. I received a particularly upsetting letter in the mail from mine this week. A bewildered letter, apologizing for missing me while she was out for a walk with my aunt Carol. I just saw Granny last month &ndash; the first trip I&rsquo;ve made back to England in 25 years (although I have seen her more recently than that). I promised then to come again soon (I&rsquo;m back in the UK next month in fact), but there seems to be confusion about what that means and when.</p>
<p>And maybe all of this is partially the motivation behind starting to chronicle what I&rsquo;m up to each week here on this blog: I&rsquo;ll be more transparent so that friends and family know where I am and why (rather than just speculating based on Facebook status updates and the like). Of course, that means I&rsquo;ll probably ditch the comments here <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/05/16/the-comments-are-closed/">as I did on Hack Education</a>. Really, it&rsquo;s not you. It&rsquo;s me.</p>
