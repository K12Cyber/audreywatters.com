<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<p>Nope. But I realize that it&#8217;s time to plan some of my <a href="http://audreywatters.com/cv/travel.html">upcoming winter travel</a>. (I have a hotel booked for Educon but not yet a flight. That's as far as I got.) Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach.</p>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ve still been tweaking my websites. I&#8217;ve created new GitHub repos (and Hack Education subdomain) for <em><a href="http://reclaim.hackeducation.com">Reclaim Your Domain</a></em>, the new book I&#8217;m working on, and for the <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">2015 Ed-Tech Trends</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve started a new project, <a href="http://horizon.hackeducation.com">Horizon Report Data Liberation</a> &#8211; which is just what it sounds like.</p>

<p>I fixed my twitter bot, <a href="http://twitter.com/audrey_ebooks">@audrey_ebooks</a> (using this great <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/06/20/random-non-sequitur-twitter-bot-instructions">guide</a> by ReadWriteWeb).</p>

<p>I performed the annual New Year ritual of updating all my passwords. I use 1Password, which made it easier for me to identify the accounts I&#8217;ve signed up for. I also took the opportunity to delete a lot of accounts for sites I don&#8217;t use. StumbleUpon? Deleted. Plancast? Deleted. Etc. Etc.</p>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ve picked back up Biella Coleman&#8217;s book on Anonymous. I watched a lot of college football on New Year&#8217;s Day. 2015 is off to a good start with the defeat of FSU and Alabama. Also: <strong>Go Ducks</strong>.</p>
