<li>ISTE was great because I spent so much time with friends. On the Tuesday of ISTE, my mom came through Philadelphia and picked me up. We&#8217;d planned to spend the day together &#8211; comforting as her mom had passed away the week before. A few minutes after we arrived at her hotel room, my little brother called. My dad had died suddenly that morning. I am struggling to write out my thoughts about him &#8211; our relationship had been strained to the point of breaking in recent years. And now my brother and I are in Casper, trying to resolve what looks to be a very messy &#8211; legally, emotionally &#8211; estate. I&#8217;m looking at my calendar for the rest of July, a month I&#8217;d set aside to finish <em>Teaching Machines</em>. And I&#8217;m just not sure what I will be able to accomplish for a while.</li>
