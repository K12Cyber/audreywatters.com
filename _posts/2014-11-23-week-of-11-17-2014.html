<h2>Travel (and Speaking)</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m still on the road (sigh). I&rsquo;ve been in Washington DC, Arlington, Virginia, and Fredericksburg, Virginia this week. At least Kin has joined me for the last couple of days. Traveling without him is miserable.</p>
<p>I spoke at <a href="http://www.opencon2014.org/">OpenCon</a>, at <a href="http://www.umw.edu/">UMW</a>, and in Alec Couros and Katia Hildebrandt&rsquo;s class EC&amp;I 831 (links to my talks are below).</p>
<p>Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach.</p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>In addition to speaking at UMW, I spent much of Tuesday meeting with various student groups. It was really great to have a chance to talk to students about the issues they&rsquo;re facing on- and offline, what activism looks like, and so on.</p>
<p>I spent Wednesday through Friday at <a href="/admin/blog/openedconference.org/2014">OpenEd</a>. I didn&rsquo;t present. I actually attended sessions. OpenEd is one of my favorite conferences, in no small part because it&rsquo;s an opportunity to see folks face-to-face that I often type at online.</p>
<p>I spent the weekend in Fredericksburg at the latest Reclaim Hackathon.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on an article (due today &ndash; crap) for <em>Model View Culture</em>.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Howard Rheingold interviewed me about the track at the upcoming DML conference for which I&rsquo;m the chair. The video is <a href="http://dml2015.dmlhub.net/dml2015-audrey-watters-chair-of-open-learningeducational-technology-track/">now available</a>. I also started some planning on the featured session that I&rsquo;m organizing for the event, which will include Kate Bowles, Tressie McMillan Cottom and myself.</p>
<p>Tressie and I had a paper accepted for an upcoming issue of <em>Humanity &amp; Society</em> &ndash; which means we need to write the paper.</p>
<p>I deleted the Uber app off my phone. In order to cancel your account, you have to write to the company and request it &ndash; I did that too. <a href="https://medium.com/matter/how-to-get-away-with-uber-75b406043733">This article by Bobbie Johnson</a> does a great job walking through many of the reasons folks hate Uber:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;And that, in the end, is the real reason so many people hate Uber: Because whatever we do, we can&rsquo;t stop ourselves from making it bigger and more successful and more terrifying and more necessary. Uber makes everything so easy, which means it shows us who, and what, we really are. It shows us how, whatever objections we might say we hold, we don&rsquo;t actually care very much at all. We have our beliefs, our morals, our instincts. We have our dislike of douchebags, our mistrust of bad behavior. We have all that. But in the end, it turns out that if something&rsquo;s 10 percent cheaper and 5 percent faster, we&rsquo;ll give it all up quicker than we can order a sandwich.&rdquo;</em></p>
