<p>I fear I&#8217;m becoming David Sedaris. No, no. I&#8217;m not worried that I&#8217;m poised to become a great American humorist. Rather, I&#8217;m worried I&#8217;m becoming <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/30/stepping-out-3">a little obsessed about the number of miles I walk each day</a>. </p>

<p>When Kin and I moved back to Hermosa Beach, I started getting up and walking each morning. We&#8217;re just a block away from The Strand, 20 miles of flat, paved path that runs along the beach &#8211; from south of us in Torrance to north of us in Santa Monica. It&#8217;s a nice walk, bustling with the SoCal exercise freaks in the mornings, dog walkers in the evenings, and on weekends far too many drunk people who&#8217;ve decided to rent bicycles. (God forbid the scooter craze comes here.)</p>

<p>From our apartment to a wall next to the &#8220;90210&#8221; Beach House and back again is 1.7 miles. That&#8217;s not quite half the made-up goal fitness trackers set of 10,000 steps a day. So I&#8217;ve started walking that route twice a day &#8211; once in the morning and once after dinner. </p>

<p>I also walk to the grocery store once (or even twice) a day &#8211; about a mile-and-a-half round-trip. Actual conversation from this week: &#8220;We forgot the Italian sausage? It&#8217;s no problem. I&#8217;ll go back to the store.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much like my return to cooking, my new obsession with walking has a lot to do with taking time away from The Internet. I can see the Malibu fires from The Strand this week, so I&#8217;m still reminded that the apocalypse is near. I&#8217;ll just walk a bit faster, I guess. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t currently own a fitness tracker, which is probably the thing that stops me from, as Sedaris described in a New Yorker article a couple of years ago, &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/30/stepping-out-3">living the Fitbit life</a>.&#8221; But I&#8217;m toying with the idea of getting one &#8211; other than the &#8220;health&#8221; app that&#8217;s pre-installed on my iPhone, which I am annoyed to have to remember to bring with me when I go out. (You see, my exercise clothes do not have pockets. Neither do many of the skirts I wear once I&#8217;ve showered and dressed for the day. But I often listen to audiobooks as I walk.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been critical of the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/06/22/fitbit">behaviorist bent of these fitness devices</a>. And I&#8217;m also worried about the privacy and security implications of casually assuming they&#8217;re a sort of medical tech. I am fearful too about a push for more surveillance in the guise of &#8220;health&#8221; and &#8220;wellbeing&#8221; &#8211; particularly when employers and insurance companies offer discounts for wearing fitness trackers.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t worn a watch in decades, but I think I want an Apple Watch (rather than a FitBit). I realize it&#8217;s a gross little piece of conspicuous tech consumption. But I can convince myself that I didn&#8217;t buy it to track my fitness because I can wear it on my wrist <em>and</em> listen to my audiobooks when I walk <em>and</em> not have to carry a bag or my phone in my hand <em>and</em>, if I get one that doesn&#8217;t have cell service, never be interrupted while I&#8217;m walking with push notifications about the latest DC dumbassery. </p>
