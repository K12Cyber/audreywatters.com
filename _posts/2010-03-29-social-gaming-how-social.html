<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/kids_playing.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-488" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" title="games" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201003kids_playing-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" /></a>I can't decide if I am fascinated by "social gaming" or appalled by "social gaming" or irritated that once again I feel this division of players into categories that just don't quite work for how I game: hardcore versus casual, social gamer versus lonely loser.<p></p>
Maybe it's the term: "social gaming." That there is a specific genre of games that one plays alone ("Solitaire"), that we've long been prompted to add another quarter for a "multi-player" option in the arcade, that you look pretty stupid playing charades by yourself (even though it'd be a helluva lot easier to guess the answer)-- all this points the obvious: most gaming is in fact social gaming.<p></p>
Even video-gaming, perhaps long stereotyped as the pastime of the isolated young man in his parents' basement, is recognized now as a group rather than an individual endeavor -- no longer hidden in his parents' basement, they all play the Wii in the living room.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/make-love-not-warcraft.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-489" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" title="Warcraft" src="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/make-love-not-warcraft-300x231.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="231" /></a>And maybe this is part of my problem. I've been a gamer for a long time, and when I game, it's inevitably social. (Instead of one lonely loser, we're, like, four lonely losers -- Woo hoo <em>D&amp;D</em>!) As an avid player of MMORPGs, a major part of my enjoyment of the gaming experience (OK, and sometimes the greatest annoyance) was the social interaction with other players: chatting with group and guildmates, working together to kill shit.<p></p>
Notice there how I said "avid" -- neither hardcore nor casual?<p></p>
Hardcore or casual -- those labels still irk me. Over the past five or so years, I've played MMOs a lot. As a graduate student I was on the computer all the time, and it may well be that many several chapters of my dissertation remain unwritten because of the dangers I had to tackle in Azeroth and Norrath. Despite playing daily, I insisted I was a casual player. I raided with some of the hardcore guilds from time to time, but not for long, unable to quite surrender my identity as a doctoral candidate and a single mom over to my identity as a dirge or a druid. (Well, admittedly, I did drop out of graduate school, but it wasn't to become a hardcore gamer. I SWEAR!) Despite self-identifying as "casual," I took my gaming pretty seriously, wanting to play well, proud of my skills, part of the gaming community. I took offense when "casual" was assumed to mean "bad player" and I didn't like it when "skilled player" meant "can I get your phone number so I can call you in the middle of the night to come raid a contested mob?"<p></p>
So yes, admittedly, my experiences as a longtime gamer color my attitude towards "social games." I like the immersion in a fantasy world; I like the real-time action. I like the graphics. I like the complexity.<p></p>
"Social games" do not offer this. (Yet.)<p></p>
<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/farmville.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-490" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" title="farmville" src="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/farmville-300x229.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="229" /></a>And I'm not sure they intend to. No doubt, the graphics of these games will undoubtedly get better, and the games will get more complex. But by design, I do not think they will provide the same real-time, immersive gaming action as MMORPGs or other traditional video games. "Social gaming" is "casual gaming" par excellence -- rather than the hour or so committed to running an instance in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, or to completing a mission in<em> Call of Duty</em>, or even to playing a game of <em>Monopoly</em>, social games require very brief and intermittent contact. Check your crops. Come back later.<p></p>
It's not necessarily very "social" at all.
