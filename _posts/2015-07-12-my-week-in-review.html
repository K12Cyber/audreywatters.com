<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>The only project this week: dealing with my dad&#8217;s death. My brother and I saw the lawyer. We saw the funeral director. Thursday was the memorial. We&#8217;ve cleaned out his apartment at the nursing home. We&#8217;ve started cleaning out his house. We&#8217;ve rescheduled our flights to stay in Casper to try to resolve some more &#8220;issues.&#8221; We've seen a ton of friends and family while in Casper, and that has been wonderful. But mostly, this trip has been horrifying.</li>
