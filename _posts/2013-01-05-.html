<p>I've already outlined on Hack Education the <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/12/28/hack-education-projects-for-2013/">projects</a> I want to tackle in the coming months -- that is, the work related to my writing and speaking about education technologies. And even though some of these do sound an awful lot like New Year's Resolutions (they're not!),&nbsp;I thought I'd quickly jotting down here on my personal blog some of the projects and goals I do have for 2013:</p>
<p>1. Optimize for happiness</p>
<p>2. Read more books</p>
<p>3. Write a book</p>
<p>4. Build bots</p>
<p>5. Be braver</p>
<p>6. Enjoy more sunsets while sitting in the sand</p>
<p>7. Swim in the ocean regularly</p>
<p>8. Travel thoughtfully</p>
<p>9. Accumulate experiences not stuff</p>
