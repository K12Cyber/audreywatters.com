<p>Just a short update on some big changes:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of my boyfriend <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a>, who&rsquo;s been named a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/24/new-round-innovators-joins-us-government-tackle-big-challenges">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a>. The year-long appointment &ndash; he&rsquo;ll be working for the VA &ndash; will involve our moving to Washington DC in August.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all been a bit of a whirlwind, as we didn&rsquo;t learn until 12 days or so ago that this was happening. We&rsquo;re not sure what we&rsquo;ll do with our apartment here in Hermosa Beach (it&rsquo;s a dive, but it&rsquo;s a dive located two blocks from the beach); we&rsquo;re not sure what we&rsquo;ll do for housing in DC (recommendations for neighborhoods and leads on sublets are welcome).</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;m writing a <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/06/11/data-tracking-and-teaching-machines/">book</a> this year, the move isn&rsquo;t going to be terribly disruptive to my work. (Maybe. I hope.) A request: help with obtaining library privileges at a university or college in the DC-area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to a stint on the east coast as I&rsquo;ll be much closer to some of my favorite people and favorite cities, even though damn, I&rsquo;m going to miss LA.</p>
