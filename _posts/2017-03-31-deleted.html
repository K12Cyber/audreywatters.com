<p>I&#8217;m deleting all my old tweets.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m deleting all my old tweets and will delete them on an ongoing basis &#8211; every tweet older than three months.</p>

<p>Why? Because I am growing increasingly uncomfortable about the way in which our historical data is weaponized online. Tweets are particularly susceptible to this &#8211; they&#8217;re particularly easy to decontextualize. And looking back on my Twitter history, I can see that how I&#8217;ve used the service has changed dramatically over the years. I can see that; I&#8217;m not sure others, without context, could or would.</p>

<p>I hit &#8220;delete.&#8221;</p>

<p>I reckon if it was an important enough idea, I blogged about it. (If I didn&#8217;t, oh well. I&#8217;ll do better from here on out.) The stories that I write on my blogs are (obviously) longer than the 140 characters of Twitter. I think they&#8217;re more nuanced. I spend more time crafting my thoughts here. Moreover, the only person that&#8217;s responsible for the words I write on my blog is me. There are no @-mentions, no retweets. Yes, I can link and cite, but those references are trackable, discoverable in a different way.</p>

<p>As someone who cares deeply about history &#8211; historical records, archives, and the like &#8211; deleting my tweets is painful. I&#8217;ll feel remorse, I&#8217;m sure. But I also feel no obligation to have my <em>personal</em> data available <em>publicly</em>, in the hands of corporations and not under my own ownership and control. (I do have a copy of all my tweets, just as I have a copy of the old Facebook account I deleted. When I die, I&#8217;ll bequeath all this digitalia to the Casper Community College library. They&#8217;ll be thrilled, I&#8217;m sure.)</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve linked to or embedded one of my tweets in an article, my apologies. I&#8217;ve taken screenshots of two of my popular ones that I see people resurface from the depths of Twitter history:</p>

<p>I also took screenshots of the story I recently told on Twitter about my experiences pre-Obamacare: &#8220;<a href="http://audreywatters.com/2017/03/12/life-death-obamacare">Life and Death Before the Affordable Care Act</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping this will encourage me to blog more. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll stop me from tweeting, although I imagine knowing that this is all quite ephemeral will probably change my behavior somewhat. We shall see. (Or we won&#8217;t see. Depends on if you or me grab screenshots.)</p>
