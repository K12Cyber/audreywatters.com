<p>I've had the tab open in my browser for almost a week now: &nbsp;Bon Stewart's <a href="http://cribchronicles.com/2012/06/15/out-out-brief-candle">final blog entry at cribchronicles.com</a>. &nbsp;She's opted to shutter the blog. &nbsp;&ldquo;there really isn&rsquo;t anything else to say, anymore,&rdquo; she writes, "and i realized that that i do not know what to do with this voice."</p>
<p>I should note: &nbsp;keeping a tab open for me means I haven't resolved what to do or say or think about a story, but I know I have to say or do or think something. &nbsp;As I've been weighing recently re-opening a blog that I shuttered years ago, one in which I too chronicled death, dying and the "dust in my mouth" from all of it, Bon's decision to "kill" that voice gives me pause.</p>
<p>Like Bon's cribchronicles, my earlier blog was the first place I wrote at length online. &nbsp;In those blog posts, I found a community of others who were experiencing similar struggles: &nbsp;the struggles of dissertating, of dealing with a partner dying of cancer, of parenting in the midst of all of it. I found a community in blogging (many of those who read that blog I consider my dear, dear friends even if we've never actually met in person); I found solace in writing. &nbsp;<br /><br />And I found my digital identity -- one of them, at least. &nbsp;But for reasons that may be similar in some respect to Bon's, I had to stop writing there. &nbsp;I haven't updated it since 2009; I only posted once that year. &nbsp;I only posted once in 2008. &nbsp;I wrote 192 entries in 2006, and 253 in 2005. &nbsp;I had to stop writing; I had to heal.</p>
<p>I recently purchased the domain that's closest to that old screen- and blog name. &nbsp;I've been thinking I'll redirect the old blog URL there, then make a new subdirectory for new writing there -- it's a bit like what Bon has done with cribchronicles.com and <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com">theory.cribchronicles.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a way -- technologically, mentally -- to split the past and the present, but to recognize that they're still connected. &nbsp;That chapter of my life is closed. &nbsp;The blog was shuttered for a reason. &nbsp;And yet all the stories and all the "me" that's there affects who I am today. &nbsp;I write with a new voice now.</p>
<p>All these considerations are complicated, of course, by the fact that that blog was pseudonymous, and that part of the new voice I now have online is here and on Hack Education. &nbsp;I'm not sure how I feel about "outing" that old identity, in part because I was so angry then, the writing so raw. &nbsp;If I start writing on the site again, can I really just return to that old, partially disguised identity? &nbsp;I am far less fearful these days about speaking my mind. &nbsp;That old voice is gone.</p>
<p>So maybe I'll just leave the blog closed and untouched. It's hard to know whether re-opening it re-opens wounds. &nbsp;I appreciate that Bon "killed" her blog, and that she can now offer a <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/2012/06/19/out-damned-spot-a-post-mortem/">post-mortem</a>. &nbsp;I've had years of distance on all this now, which is what makes the desire to resurface all of this so fascinating and, frankly, so awful.</p>
