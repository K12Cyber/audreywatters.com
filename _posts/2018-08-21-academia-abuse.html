<p>I have stories. I think most people I know who went to graduate school do. Stories of abuse and predation of grad students by professors. </p>

<p>And what&#8217;s always been deeply troubling to me &#8211; I mean, beyond the pervasiveness of the harassment, of course &#8211; is that many of the professors perpetrating the abuse were the very same ones whose work was about theorizing and even dismantling systems of power and hierarchy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve watched the story of Nimrod Reitman and his former NYU grad school advisor Avital Ronell unfold in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/nyregion/sexual-harassment-nyu-female-professor.html">pages of The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/New-Disclosures-About-an-NYU/244278">The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>. &#8220;The Dangerous Intimacy of Grad School,&#8221; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/nyregion/avitall-ronell-nyu-title-ix.html">one headline read</a>.</p>

<p>I left graduate school over a decade ago &#8211; not because it was too intimate, but because it was at once too controlling and too callous. So I think, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Unsexy-Truth-About-the/244314">as Corey Robin has written</a>, that these discussions often get caught up on the sex and ignore the issues of <a href="https://medium.com/@amyelizabethrobinson/on-power-and-aporia-in-the-academy-a-response-in-three-parts-f7387c346ffa">power</a> and domination &#8211; &#8220;Ronell&#8217;s largest claims were on his time, on his life, on his attention and energy, well beyond the legitimate demands of an adviser on an advisee.&#8221;</p>

<p>I do not believe this sort of behavior is <a href="https://kfitz.info/stars/">exclusive to academia</a>. Nor do I think that it&#8217;s particularly <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1031167717125120000">new</a>. </p>

<p>Indeed, reading B. F. Skinner&#8217;s autobiography &#8211; I&#8217;m now on Book Two, which chronicles his time as a graduate student at Harvard and as an early career professor &#8211; it is so apparent that the &#8220;star system&#8221; has long, long roots. And as I think about Skinner&#8217;s own influence &#8211; how his name has become synonymous with teaching machines despite the others (inside and outside of academia) who were working in the field at the same time &#8211; I am certain that these systems of prestige and power deform the development of disciplines and skew the creation and dissemination of knowledge. </p>
