<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Most of the week was spent in Hermosa Beach. Kin and I boarded a flight to Sydney at 10:30 Friday night. We landed in Australia at 8 Sunday morning. I have no idea WTF time it is right now or what day it is. Stupid International Date Line. But also: how amazing! I am in Australia!</li>
<li>Upcoming week: Sydney, then back to Hermosa.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m posting my &#8220;history of education technology&#8221; series on Medium (as well as on Hack Education, of course) in a publication called &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/the-history-of-the-future-of-education">The History of the Future of Education</a>.&#8221; I&#8217;ve reached out to a couple of companies that have pretty important stories to tell, and I am super excited about this series.</li>
<li>I wrote a draft of my talk that I&#8217;ll be giving at <a href="http://changschooltalks.ryerson.ca/">Ryerson University</a> in a week and a half.</li>
<li>I was caught up with my writing goals for <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>, until I lost a Saturday this week. Thanks again, International Date Line.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I watched the Super Bowl. Ugh. I hate the Patriots. I mean, I don&#8217;t really like the Seattle Seahawks either (Damn you, Brian Bosworth!) &#8211; exceptions: Richard Sherman and Marshawn Lynch. I'm too tired to make a Left Shark joke about the halftime show. That's how jet-lagged I am.</li>
<li>I watched <em>Birdman</em>. Wow. I also caught <em>The Nightcrawler</em> on the flight.</li>
<li>I finished <em>The Race to Oz</em>. I started the next in the series, <em>The Emerald City of Oz.</em> And I picked back up <em>Never Mind the Laptops</em>, which is probably the best history of ed-tech I&#8217;ve ever read.</li>
