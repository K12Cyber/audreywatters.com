<h2>Travel</h2>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin</a> and I flew home from Barcelona on Monday. And other than that, this week has been travel-free. We don&rsquo;t have a car, so everywhere we went this week was within walking distance of home. Fortunately for us, that includes the beach and a great club, Saint Rocke.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next week</span>: In Hermosa 'til Sunday, when I'm off to the UK. But Kin is headed in another direction. Bummer.</p>
<h2>Watching, Reading, Listening</h2>
<p>On Wednesday night, we saw Camper Van Beethoven perform. I&rsquo;ve had &ldquo;Take the Skinheads Bowling&rdquo; stuck in my head ever since.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hackedu/camper.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Between time on a plane and time on the couch, I watched <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em> (hated it) and <em>Grand Budapest Hotel</em> (loved it).</p>
<p>Between the watching and listening and writing and working, I failed to make time to finish Piketty. My favorite read this week (and truthfully, it&rsquo;s my favorite thing about email these days) was <a href="http://tinyletter.com/todayintabs/">Rusty Fowler&rsquo;s Today in Tabs</a> on Friday: #Hashtag Real Talk about Marc Andreessen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What Marc Andreessen looks like to me is a chilled butter sculpture made of pure privilege, and what I hate about him is the acceptance of that privilege that still lurks inside of me, all the time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Hack Education Writing</h2>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/04/yesallwomen-iste-code-of-conduct/">#YesAllWomen and Ed-Tech Conferences, or Why ISTE is Unsafe</a> <br /><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/06/hack-education-weekly-news-6-6-2014/">Hack Education Weekly News: Senior Pranks and the School-to-Prison Pipeline</a> <br /><a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters/letters/hack-education-weekly-newsletter-no-63">Hack Education Weekly Newsletter, No. 63</a> <br /><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/07/what-should-technologists-know-about-education/">No Really, What Should Technologists Know About Education?</a></p>
<h2>Editing Educating Modern Learners</h2>
<p>The theme this week on EML was the relationship between new technologies, data, and science. I wrote about <a href="http://modernlearners.com/from-the-quantified-student-to-the-quantified-self/">the &ldquo;quantified self&rdquo; and the &ldquo;quantified student.&rdquo;</a> And Cedar Riener wrote about <a href="http://modernlearners.com/the-science-of-the-mind-in-the-classroom-of-the-future/">brain science research, and pedagogy</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What You Should Know This Week</span>: <a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-10/">Apple and WWDC</a> (actually, I&rsquo;d say what you should know this week is that there are <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/04/yesallwomen-iste-code-of-conduct/">threats against women in ed-tech</a> on- and offline, but I could only write so much about it.)</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I wrote an article about how the ed-tech industry might shape reading for <em>Knowledge Quest</em>, the official journal of the American Association of School Librarians.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://hapgood.us/2014/06/04/smallest-federated-wiki-as-an-alternate-vision-of-the-web/">Mike Caulfield</a>, I&rsquo;ve been playing around with the &ldquo;<a href="http://audrey.hapgood.net:3000/view/welcome-visitors">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I killed my LinkedIn account this week &ndash; a small step as part of larger &ldquo;<a href="http://reclaimyourdomain.org/">Reclaim Your Domain</a>&rdquo; efforts that Kin and I are working on. <a href="https://github.com/reclaim-your-domain/reclaim-your-domain">There&rsquo;s a Github repo</a>!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/2010trends">Github repos</a> for the &ldquo;ed-tech trends&rdquo; research I do each year. (I have lots of thinking to do whether Github or the Federated Wiki is the better tool for me here.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only been writing these weekly reviews for a couple of weeks now, but I&rsquo;m already finding it a helpful exercise to reflect on my writing and thinking &ndash; on what I&rsquo;ve done. But this week the question of &ldquo;what have I done?&rdquo; takes on a bit of a different meaning, what with all the accusations flying around ed-tech. What have I done? What have I said? What should I have done? What should I have said? I worry that the consensus is &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo;</p>
