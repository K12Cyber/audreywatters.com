<p>Bryan Alexander <a href="https://bryanalexander.org/2017/05/06/my-ruthless-facebook-purge-of-spring-2017/">wrote this morning</a> that he was making his &ldquo;ruthless Facebook purge of spring 2017,&rdquo; announcing his plans to remove some of his &ldquo;friends&rdquo; on Facebook. I don&rsquo;t have nearly as many connections on Facebook &ndash; no doubt because I deleted my account a few years ago and only signed up again for a new one. I&rsquo;ve been fairly cautious about who I &ldquo;friend&rdquo; there, as I am uninterested in having a large Facebook network to manage. I have a Facebook page for Hack Education and a page for myself as a writer. I figure that folks can follow along there if they want updates about what I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>I do regularly unfollow people on Twitter. A few years ago, I trimmed my follow numbers by about half. I now follow about 800 people, which doesn&rsquo;t seem like too few or too many. (I also rely on lists of journalists and news organizations rather than following these accounts directly.)</p>
<p>Bryan&rsquo;s efforts seem to address culling the composition <em>of the network</em>. What I&rsquo;ve been doing recently &ndash; and I&rsquo;m thinking now about how similar or different this might be from what Bryan is up to &ndash; is culling my own history <em>on the network</em>.</p>
<p>I now delete all Facebook and Twitter posts that are older than 90 days*. I also delete all email that&rsquo;s older than a year. (This past week&rsquo;s phishing scam using a fake Google Docs app alongside the hacking attack on the Macron campaign demonstrated, I think, how <a href="https://twitter.com/holden/status/860115163805921280">vulnerable</a> all our documents and messages and connections are in email. I mean, I thought we&rsquo;d have learned it earlier thanks to Wikileaks&rsquo; release of the DNC&rsquo;s emails. But hey.)</p>
<p>I think Bryan is severing ties to certain accounts on Facebook because he wants to see better information and he wants his own posts to be more readily seen. Me, I am deleting information because I am not interested in the retention of data as part of a weaponized information gaze. But by deleting &ldquo;friends&rdquo; and by deleting posts, we both are actively and willfully reshaping our social networks. We are making adjustments to the reach and level of activity that will certainly alter our &ldquo;presence&rdquo; online &ndash; in no small part too because these networks increasingly display us information algorithmically.</p>

Before deleting anything &ndash; Facebook, Twitter, Gmail &ndash; I made sure to download a copy of my data.</em></p>
