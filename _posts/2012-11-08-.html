<p><em>At some point in my life I'll write everything down that I haven't blogged already about Anthony's death and dying. I'll go through my blog archives and dig up the stories that my memory has (thankfully) diminished. But I wrote this yesterday, even though "the morning after" this year's election felt pretty triumphant for me. I do know how personal despair can interweave with political despair...</em></p>
<h2>The Day After (2004)</h2>
<p>I admit, my mind wasn&rsquo;t on the turnout of the election. But I&rsquo;d assumed &mdash; naively so &mdash; that the mess that George W. Bush had put us in during his first term in office would make him a one term President. The only reason I even voted in the 2004 election was that Oregon offers vote-by-mail. Because when election day came, I was in the hospital waiting room, waiting waiting waiting while my husband had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his liver.</p>
<p>The surgery was over 10 hours long; the tumor over 8 lbs. The day after the surgery (the day after the election), Anthony remained in ICU. And so the day after the surgery (the day after the election), I sat in the waiting room of the emergency ICU.</p>
<p>I sat there watching the final election returns and news analysis on the television &mdash; the volume off, of course, as is common in public waiting areas. But I could see Senator John Kerry mouthing a concession speech, despite the questions that remained about voting machines and voting counts.</p>
<p>I remember Kerry&rsquo;s concession, not because of what he said &mdash; clearly, I couldn&rsquo;t hear a word of it &mdash; but because it was timed with the thunderous silence of the pain of all of us sitting in that emergency ICU waiting room.</p>
<p>One family sat clustered and crying, their son &mdash; a member of the Oregon National Guard &mdash; had tried to take his life the night before. The doctor came out, head shaking and voice lowered. The family had &ldquo;a decision&rdquo; to make, he informed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A decision.&rdquo; A concession.</p>
<p>Hope and hopelessness, both grimmly personal and political.</p>
