<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2015-1">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>A couple more thoughts on the "top ed-tech trends" that I'm jotting down here (because where else):</p>
<ul>
<li>How might the recent instability of the Chinese economy affect all that ed-tech investment startups have received there?</li>
<li>Trigger warnings, "Quit Lit," social media shaming, etc -- what do these genres (and by genre, I mean the onslaught of "think pieces" and Vox-splaining) say about higher ed (as represented by The Media)</li>
</ul>
