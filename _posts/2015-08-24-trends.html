<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2015">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>There are still many months before I start my annual round-up of ed-tech trends, but I think about the project year round. Here are the things I'm tracking on -- clearly I've got to narrow this down by December:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Business of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>The Politics of Ed-Tech</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Data and Algorithms</li>
<li>Outsourcing and Privatization</li>
<li>Free College?</li>
<li>The Collapse of For-Profit Higher Ed (Or Not)</li>
<li>Online Education (the Hype formerly Known as &ldquo;MOOC&rdquo;)</li>
<li>The Common Core State Standards</li>
<li>Opt-Out and Testing</li>
<li>School as Skills Training - "The Employability Narrative"</li>
<li>Annotation (and the Indie Web)</li>
</ol>
