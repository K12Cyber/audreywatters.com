<p><a href="https://news.elearninginside.com/think-personalized-learning-is-new-and-innovative-ask-audrey-watters/">E-Learning Inside News covered the talk I gave at CUNY</a>: &#8220;Think Personalized Learning is New and Innovative? Ask Audrey Watters.&#8221; (I wasn&#8217;t contacted about this. So in some ways, it&#8217;s simply a re-write of my talk.)</p>
