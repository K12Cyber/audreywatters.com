<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t leave Hermosa this week. But Kin did &ndash; he&rsquo;s up in San Francisco, and I miss him fiercely. It&rsquo;s rare that our schedules have us going in different directions, and I&rsquo;m miserable when it does.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next week</span> (for me): Bolton (just outside of Manchester, UK)</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>No really. I&rsquo;m almost done with Piketty&rsquo;s book. Really. I promise this time.</p>
<h2>Hack Education Writing</h2>
<p><a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/13/hack-education-weekly-news-6-13-2014/">Hack Education Weekly News</a> <br /><a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters/letters/hack-education-weekly-newsletter-no-64">Hack Education Weekly Newsletter</a></p>
<h2>Editing Educating Modern Learners</h2>
<p>I wrote both articles that appeared on EML this week: <br /><a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-should-school-leaders-know-about-adaptive-learning/"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-should-school-leaders-know-about-adaptive-learning/">What Should School Leaders Know About Adaptive Learning?</a> <br /><a href="http://modernlearners.com/the-problem-with-personalization/">The Problem with &ldquo;Personalization&rdquo;</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What You Should Know This Week</span>: <em><a href="http://modernlearners.com/what-you-should-know-this-week-11/">Vergara v California</a></em> &ndash; that is, Silicon Valley&rsquo;s latest attempt to destroy workers&rsquo; rights</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I spent most of the week working on the keynote I&rsquo;m giving on Wednesday at CETIS14. I also spent some time cheering on the LA Kings, Stanley Cup champs. #GoKingsGo! It's harder to muster interest in the World Cup.</p>
<p>It feels weird to brag about what's really a very small triumph, but perhaps it's worth noting that ISTE Unplugged and ISTE itself added Codes of Conduct this week that specifically address harassment. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/04/yesallwomen-iste-code-of-conduct/">Win. Right?</a></p>
<h2>Family</h2>

<p>My kid turned 21 on Wednesday, triggering all sorts of feels. He&rsquo;s back on the road again, having only stayed with me a month-ish. Onward. And such.</p>
