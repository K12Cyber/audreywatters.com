<p><a href="http://rhizomatic.net/2015/05/12/week-5-is-community-learning-an-invasive-species/">Here's Dave Cormier's prompt for #rhizo15, week 5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rhizomatic plants are chaotic, aggressive and resilient. It models some of the qualities that can make a good learner. The rhizome, however, can also be an invasive species. It can choke other plants out of your garden such that only the rhizomatic plant remains. We&rsquo;ve just heard from Aras that &ldquo;the number of active participants [on twitter] are decreasing while density (interaction in the rhizo community) is increasing&rdquo;. How do we make sure there is always room for new and contrarian voices? Do we need to create a them to have a we? How do we cultivate a community learning ecosystem so that it continues to grow outward rather than inward? What does that mean for learning?<br /><br />Must rhizomatic learning be an invasive species?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel like we're mixing metaphors now, and in the process likely getting the philosophy <em>and</em> the biology <em>and</em> the politics wrong.</p>
<p>"Invasive species" is a such loaded phrase here -- intentionally so, no doubt. It's one that describes plant life that is, when introduced, quite destructive. Planting bamboo can indeed overwhelm the other plants in one's garden; but growth via underground roots and rhizomes are not the only way biologically invasive species spread. And a focus on the biology -- on the rhizome -- might obscure the other factors that lead to the species' presence in the first place. Why is bamboo a threat to the Portland garden? How did bamboo move from Asia to Europe and the US? It wasn't through rhizomatic growth and the amazing reproduction of the bamboo system; it was through imperialism.</p>
<p>Is that how rhizomatic learning envisions itself? As an invasive species, a biological consequence of imperialism? Why focus on the invasion? Rhizomes are, after all, <em>natural</em> -- a rapid and expansive growth from and through the roots. We only place a value judgment on this when it occurs in another ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why frame those involved in #rhizo15 as an invasive, destructive force? What sort of reflection does this prompt?</p>
<p>(Does it prompt any? Because I do feel as though the notion of choking out other ideas and organisms is an important one. #Rhizo15 is not necessarily a garden where I would plant new things...)</p>
