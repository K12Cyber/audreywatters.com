<p>I&#8217;ve made some changes to my websites, most obviously updating the header image across all the Hack Education projects. That's <a href="http://bryanmmathers.com/">thanks to Bryan Mathers</a>, of course. (<a href="http://pigeons.hackeducation.com/">Why a pigeon</a>?)</p>

<p>Those who look closely will also note that I have changed the copyright information on my work. Or rather, no longer is there a Creative Commons license on Hack Education material or on my personal blog. This really doesn&#8217;t change much, I promise. <em>It just means you have to ask my permission</em> before republishing my work.
