<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I feel like I started getting back to normal-ish after my dad's death. I'm so behind on projects and a little panicky about what I have to accomplish in the coming weeks.</li>
<li>I completed the edits for my upcoming book <em>Claim Your Domain</em>.</li>
<li>I updated how my sites handle header images (as the GitHub repos are gigantic). I completed audreywatters.com and but barely made a dent in fixing the images on hackeducation.com.</li>
<li>I received my certificate for the edX MOOC on superheroes.</li>
<li>I (re)started therapy.</li>
<li>I got a haircut for the first time in about six years.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I started watching the Harry Potter movies, which I&#8217;ve never seen before. (I watched the first three.) The movies are mostly "meh" although they reminded me of how much I enjoyed reading the books out loud with the kid.</li>
<li>I read Ta-Nehisi Coates&#8217; new book <em>Between the World and Me</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Kin and I went to Gary Stager&#8217;s birthday party, which was of course super-fun.</li>
</ul>
