<p>How do we separate the &ldquo;personal&rdquo; from the &ldquo;professional&rdquo;? I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s ever possible; I don&rsquo;t think it would be desirable.</p>
<p>There are lots of times I see Tweets on topics I don&rsquo;t care about: television shows, awards shows, baseball games, presidential debates, and so on. It&rsquo;s not that hard to ignore them. (I use Tweetbot, for what it&rsquo;s worth, which does make it easy to mute individuals and mute hashtags.) Me, I&rsquo;m far more likely to unfollow educators who tweet uncritically about ed-tech than I am to unfollow those who tweet about breakfast or basketball.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about your comments here are that you feel as though you are not a part of a sports-Twitter community in quite the same way as you are the education-Twitter one (and perhaps, by extension, that being more a part of the former diminishes your position in the latter). But do you think these two communities have similar practices, shared values? Do you think &ldquo;community&rdquo; looks the same when it comes to talking about these two topics on Twitter? How are they shaped &ndash; differently? &ndash; by loyalty, by fandom (and I realize that&rsquo;s just one small part of sports-Twitter and, arguably, one small part of education-Twitter too)? How are they shaped by collaboration and not competition?</p>
<p>I wonder if, even with a sports-focused account, you&rsquo;d find the same sort of connection via sports-Twitter that you&rsquo;ve found via education-related circles.</p>
