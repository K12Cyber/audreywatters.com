I've got <em>tons</em> to say.<p></p>
Thoughts on <a href="http://www.formspring.me/audreywatters">Formspring</a>.  Thoughts on <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>. Thoughts on open source. Thoughts on living with another geek.  Thoughts on working from home.  Thoughts on the new New Pornographers album. Thoughts on Apple closing down <a href="http://www.lala.com">Lala</a>. Thoughts on the novel I'm reading (<em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> -- on my iPad). Thoughts on <em>Spamalot</em> and genetics and Dr. Who and 99 cent Flake Bars and what our grandfathers would say about us now.<p></p>
I've got index cards strewn across my desk, scribbled with thoughts on potential blog topics, things I should research, things I should read.  I've got wikis and Google Docs and Evernote notes.<p></p>
I've far from exhausted my pool of ideas, resources, words.<p></p>
Someone commented the other day on one of my RWW posts, challenging the authority with which I wrote on a particular topic.  Fair enough.  But now I think about that in terms of my professional and my personal and my public posts.<p></p>
And I think about the space I want (I need) to carve out for me, for my writing, for my new writing life.
