<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/ed-tech-disclosure-bot">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Project idea</strong>: I&rsquo;m going to make an ed-tech disclosure bot. I&rsquo;m tired of seeing so little disclosure in education technology of financial relationships &ndash; by publications, investors, and educators alike.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like the bot to retweet tweets where there is a lack of disclosure (in a story that&rsquo;s linked to or in the tweet itself) &ndash; highlighting when someone is an investor or an advisory board member in the topic they&rsquo;re tweeting about, for example, or highlighting when a publication shares an investor with the topic they&rsquo;re covering, or&hellip;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can automate this. Perhaps I could take a Twitter bot like <a href="https://twitter.com/talkpaybot">@talkpayBot</a> &ndash; <a href="https://github.com/TheAlphaNerd/talkpay-bot">its code is on GitHub</a> &ndash; and tweak it. (I like the idea of receiving DMs and tips.) I&rsquo;ll also set up a subdomain on Hack Education so I can I list each Ed-Tech Disclosure Bot tweet and provided more information about the relationships.</p>
