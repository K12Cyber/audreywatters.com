I loved the first <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com">Humble Indie Bundle</a> -- loved the concept of pay-what-you-want video games, loved the open-sourcing of the games, loved the money that went to charity, and simply loved the games themselves.  So I was thrilled when I heard from Jeffrey Rosen and John Graham that they were doing it again (Bonus good news: the Humble Bundle's been accepted into <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>.)<p></p>

This second <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/humble_bundle_launches_another_pay-what-you-want_v.php">bundle</a> lets you pay what you want to download 5 DRM-free games: ritically-rated puzzle game <a href="http://www.braid-game.com/">Braid</a>, point-and-click adventure game <a href="http://machinarium.net/demo/">Machinarium</a>, puzzle game <a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/">Osmos</a>, action game <a href="http://www.datarealms.com/">Cortex Command</a> and a new real-time strategy game (launching as part of the bundle) <a href="http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/">Revenge of the Titans</a>.<p></p>
Since the launch last week, the second Humble Bundle has brought in $1,575,752.46 from over 200,000 customers.  Yesterday, Humble Bundle announced it was throwing in the 6 games from the first bundle for those who donate more than the average original amount.  That means for a minimum of $7.60, you'll get 11 games.  There were no initial announcements about plans to open source the games this time around, but apparently <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/humble/status/18010174983766016">Revenge of the Titans will be open sourced</a> if the bundle reaches $1.75 million.<p></p>
I plan to (finally) play these games over the next few days, and I'm going to write reviews, just like I (eventually) did the last <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/06/21/preview-of-upcoming-humble-indie-bundle-review-because-this-isnt-a-news-blog-ya-know/">bundle</a> around.
