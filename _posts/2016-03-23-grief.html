<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2016/grief-and-love-and-writing-about-education">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>One of my favorite sports writers, Jessica Luther, was a guest on a recent episode of The Garbage Time Podcast with Katie Nolan. (You can listen <a href="https://soundcloud.com/garbagetimepodcast/ep-24-jessica-luther">via Soundcloud</a>.) I follow Jessica&rsquo;s work really closely, particularly her coverage of college sports and sexual violence. Too often, those of us who talk about/writing about/work in &ldquo;ed-tech&rdquo; fail to place it in context of institutions or culture, and frankly it&rsquo;s hard for me to think about higher education without also thinking about some of the issues that sports bring to the forefront: labor, race, gender, loyalty, violence.</p>
<p>On The Garbage Time Podcast, Jessica and Katie talked about the struggles of writing about (or watching) something you love &ndash; that is, in their case, sports &ndash; when it continues to be beyond disappointing &ndash; dangerous, exploitative, wrong. How do you manage your feelings about this when it&rsquo;s your work, when the thing you love is also this thing that makes you angry, when you have to grieve as you write&hellip;</p>
