<p>I'm currently a mentor for a wonderful <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer to Peer University</a> "class" called <a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/writing-for-the-web/">Writing for the Web</a>.  I have class in quotation marks there as it's described as a "learning challenge" -- a new type of offering from P2PU that focuses more on mentorship and social learning and less on a set curriculum or course of study.</p>
<p>The second challenge involves thinking about how writing for the Web differs from writing that was intended for a print audience.  And even though I helped think through the design of these challenges, I admit: this one has had me a little stumped.  That's because, thanks to the work I do, I actually read very little that <em>isn't</em> written for the Web.</p>
<h2>Reading Then</h2>
<p>It's an interesting change in my reading habits, the patterns of which I've long monitored -- with some of the credit going to my fourth grade teacher Mrs. Eudaley, who had the class build a bookworm based on our book reports.  A construction paper circle for each segment of its body listed our names, the title and mini-book report.  The bookworm grew the more we read. I read 101 books (and wrote 101 book reports) that year, proudly sending the class's bookworm spiraling around the room and out the door.</p>
<p>I've been fixated on monitoring my reading consumption since then.</p>
<p>As such I couldn't help but notice the way in which grad school and a PhD in literature, of all things, destroyed my interest in reading for pleasure.  No time.  No inclination.  Oh sure, I read a lot in grad school, but I read what was assigned by my professors or demanded by my research.</p>
<h2>Writing Now</h2>
<p>And now?  Now I write for a living, and -- how perfect for this P2PU challenge -- I write for the Web.  But just as grad school altered my habits -- what I consume, what I produce -- so too does my work now.</p>
<p><a href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/writing-for-the-web/content/writing-for-the-web-is-a-different-animal/">This week's challenge</a>:  find an article originally intended for a print audience.  Summarize/synthesize for a blog post. Think about the following questions: what's different?  Length, tone?  How is it different visually? How does the reading experience differ?</p>
<p>What struck me as I thought about how I'd complete this challenge is how very little reading I do that isn't online. I mean, I spend my days and nights reading (and of course writing) -- reading blog posts, reading social media status updates, reading newspaper stories online, reading magazine articles online.  Now granted, the latter sometimes appear in print publications. But most of what I read is written for the Web.</p>
<h2>Form and Content, On and Offline</h2>
<p>How does that, in turn, shape the way I write?  It's certainly changed the length of what I write -- no more 20 page papers as most posts I write range between 250 and 1500 words.  It's changed the frequency -- I write daily and publish quickly.  I try to think about "ledes" to engage the reader quickly (a style of opening that's challenging for me to adopt, I admit, since I was long schooled in introductory paragraphs -- a different beast).  I think about headlines and sub-headers.  I think about how to get people to click on a link to one of my stories, and I think about how to get them to read (or scan more likely) all the way to the end, and I think about doing the things that would motivate people to share it via Twitter, Facebook and the like.</p>
<p>There are plenty of writers and publishers who wring their hands over the move from paper to screen -- okay, well, there's <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/">Nicholas Carr</a> for starters.  And I do think it's worth thinking about -- as this week's challenge has prompted me to do -- what it means for readers and writers when we make this shift.  I'm not talking about a value judgement necessarily.  I'll leave that to Carr et al.  But I do think that there are issues with both form and content that any writer would want to consider.</p>
<p>For me, I want to pause and think about my craft as a writer. I do value long-form. I do value contemplation. I do value well-crafted prose. &nbsp;Some days, it doesn't feel like there's a lot of that on the Web. &nbsp;That's not to say there couldn't be. &nbsp;That's not to say that I can't be someone who writes thoughtfully and well and at length online. &nbsp;So, now I have to figure out if my reading habits -- again, mostly devoted to the Web nowadays -- are going to help me do that. &nbsp;Or if I need to carve out more time to read print.</p>
