<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/ed-tech-as-dd">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m supposed to run a workshop next week in Sun City, and I really have no idea what I&rsquo;m going to say or what we&rsquo;re going to do. The title is something about the hype and hope and history of ed-tech. Not sure how to &ldquo;workshop&rdquo; that.</p>
<p>One idea I had, which I am not certain is going to work for an international audience, would be to write imagined futures of education &ndash; design fiction for ed-tech. Or specifically ed-tech as D&amp;D.</p>
<p>I often invoke Bruce Sterling&rsquo;s 2013 talk on &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/2VIoRYPZk68">fantasy prototypes and real disruption</a>&rdquo; as he talks there about dragons &ndash; in this case, tech startups&rsquo; dragons: part of a</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tacit allegiance between the hackerspace favelas of the startups and offshore capital in tax-avoidance money-laundering, building a globalized networked society. &hellip;We&rsquo;re all auto-colonialized by the austerity. That&rsquo;s your big dragon. That&rsquo;s your actual dragon. And as long as you are making the rich guys richer you are not disrupting the austerity. You are one of its top facilitators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so I think this a lot: what are education&rsquo;s dragons? What are education technology&rsquo;s dragons? <em>How is ed-tech actually a facilitator for education's biggest dragon?</em></p>
<p>Slaying that dragon &ndash; that&rsquo;s an epic tale, right? It&rsquo;s fantasy, sure. It is also, as Sterling suggests, the basis for <em>a fantasy prototype</em>, where we can use tales to think about the future that we&rsquo;re working towards (or the future that we&rsquo;re working against).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine, in a D&amp;D sort of framework, if we &ldquo;roll&rdquo; a character: Charisma. Intelligence. Wisdom. Strength. Grit (LOL), I mean Constitution. Dexterity. Choose a Class. (Oh &ndash; you get to <em>choose</em> a Class in D&amp;D.) Choose a Race. (Mhmmm. Yeah. Choose that.) Choose an Alignment. Pick your Gender. (Pick! Roll!) Imagine your backstory.</p>
<p>Then, how would we, in a D&amp;D framework, move that character through the &ldquo;dungeons&rdquo; of education? What are the obstacles, traps, monsters, rewards? (What are the technological obstacles, traps, monsters, rewards?)</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s not a fully fleshed out workshop by any means, but I&rsquo;d sure love to be a Dungeon Master and eventually walk a group through an adventure like this&hellip;</p>
<p>I'd love to stew some more with more folks on ed-tech's dragons. On who gets to be ed-tech's heroes. What are the narratives we write for them? What are the maps someone (the dungeon master -- who is that again?) has ordained for adventurers to walk through? How do we go off map? How do we write a different tale?</p>
<p><em>How do we slay this dragon?</em></p>
