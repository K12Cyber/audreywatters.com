<h2>The Promise</h2><p></p>
I made Isaiah a promise a while ago that we would stay in Eugene until he graduates from high school.  And then, no matter what direction life takes him - work, college, travel - life will be taking me out of Eugene.  <p></p>
Initially I thought I'd probably head north to Portland.  Then things shifted, and I figured I'd head south to San Francisco.  But things are <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/10/2237/">shifting again</a>, and I think I'll be heading lots of places.<p></p>
(<em>Sample itinerary</em>:  Next weekend, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">Kin</a> and I are in Palo Alto.  The following weekend I'm in Seattle, and he's taking on a new job that'll have him back-and-forth from the Bay Area to NYC.  I'm in the Bay Area from the end-ish of October to the beginning-ish of November.  And hopefully I can catch a trip with Kin that heads east somewhere in there too.)<p></p>
<h2>The Plan</h2><p></p>
Clearly I'm making the switch to tech-gypsy-hood.<p></p>
See, as a freelance writer and tech-blogger, all I need in order to work is my laptop, Internet, and power (and it's the latter that can be the biggest pain-in-the-ass, i find).  So I'm planning to take full advantage of the fact that I can go anywhere, be anywhere, and work anywhere.  I'm going to whittle down my belongings so they fit into a backpack, and I'm going to travel.  San Francisco and New York, obviously.  But anywhere really.<p></p>
<h2>The Packrat</h2><p></p>
Of course, it's still eight months until Isaiah finishes school.  But as I'm renowned for being both a procrastinator and a packrat, it's probably best I start dealing with things now.<p></p>
So, Interwebz, how do I go about getting rid of my books?  <p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201003books_may10.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201003books_may10.jpg" alt="" title="books_may10" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-932" /></a>I had the realization this time last year that it was unlikely that I'd ever return to graduate school and as such, unnecessary for me to hang on to every single book I had ever read or purchased for college.  So I got rid of a lot of books.  I carted them down to the local used bookstore - probably a dozen milk crates full - but they only bought a handful.<p></p>
Only a handful of the bookshelves and bookshelves and bookshelves I still possess.<p></p>
And so I'm torn:  Go through that process again.  Or try to sell them on eBay or Amazon.  Or ship them to a friend or relative's house.  Or give them to Isaiah and tell him that bookshelves in his new apartment will help him score smart chicks.<p></p>
Any advice?
