<p>Like hundreds of thousands of folks, I signed up for <a href="http://www.codeyear.com/">Code Year</a> in January, 2012. This was the year I was going to l<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2012/11/27/top-ed-tech-trends-of-2012-learning-to-code/">earn how to code</a>.</p>
<p>Except I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Well, not like that. Not via a weekly email that pointed me to Codecademy lessons on Javascript and whatnot.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2012/12/24/24-code-academy.o.jpg/a_560x375.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the first to confess that I&rsquo;ve failed to follow through on this particular New Year&rsquo;s resolution. New York Magazine&rsquo;s Kevin Roose just published a &ldquo;<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/12/public-apology-to-codecademy.html">Public Apology to Codecademy</a>&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;m sorry, Codecademy. I&rsquo;m sorry for the broken promises. I&rsquo;m sorry for the wasted e-mails, the futile bytes spent chasing after a man who was never really going to love you back. I&rsquo;m sorry you had to resort to thinly veiled passive-aggression there at the end, and I&rsquo;m sorry that despite all your entreaties &mdash; 72 in all &mdash; I never got up the nerve to take the first step that might have landed me on the road to code.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Roose, I never clicked on any of the emails I received from Codecademy. We can debate, I realize, whether or not I ever had any intentions of doing so, <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2011/10/28/codecademy-and-the-future-of-not-learning-to-code/">considering my vocal criticism of the startup</a>&rsquo;s pedagogy.</p>
<p>But my doubts about one Web-based learn-to-code curriculum certainly didn&rsquo;t stop me from experimenting with numerous others. During Code Year, I signed up for Udacity&rsquo;s CS101. I signed up for Coursera&rsquo;s CS101. I signed up for the edX introductory CS class. I signed up for the Mechanical MOOC. I test drove lots of learn-to-code startups&rsquo; sites.</p>
<p>None of it stuck.</p>
<p>Unlike Roose, I think I really <em>do</em> want to learn more code. And unlike Roose, I'm not inclined to apologize that I'm a Codecademy-Udacity-dropout, even though I tend to agree with him when he tells these startups that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I mean, it must be...</p>
<p>Because this year more than any, I&rsquo;ve buried myself in code. I&rsquo;ve looked at a bunch of API calls. I&rsquo;ve looked at API developer areas and API documentation. I&rsquo;ve moved my domains from GoDaddy to Hover and I&rsquo;ve learned all about DNS. I&rsquo;ve played around with scripting in Google Docs (now Drive). I&rsquo;ve tried my hand at Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>. I&rsquo;ve started creating GitHub repositories for my work (although admittedly, they&rsquo;re all Markdown, HTML, and text). Most importantly, I&rsquo;ve tinkered with the PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my websites.</p>
<p>And really, <strong><em>this is what I want to do</em></strong>. I want to be able to support my sites &mdash; everything from the DNS to the database. I want to control my digital identity. I want access to my data. I want to be able to ask questions that data and against any open data in my profession (for me, that&rsquo;s education). I want to be able to solve my own digital problems &mdash; and not just, &ldquo;please cycle the modem&rdquo; sorts of bullshit. I want to be able to hack my world.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I want to do much more. I want to learn much more. I&rsquo;m pretty reliant on <a href="http://kinlane.com">my boyfriend&rsquo;s</a> engineering skills and his willingness to answer my basic questions. And I don&rsquo;t like it that my eyeballs still spin back in my head when someone mentions regular expressions. And kids, I do so badly want to be able to make a Twitter-bot that responds to link-baity ed-tech posts with some sort of <a href="http://gawker.com/5887697/">@horse_ebooks witticism</a>. And such.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I can get this in a weekly email newsletter. I don&rsquo;t think I can get this when the final project is building a card game. I don&rsquo;t think I can get it when the final project is building a search engine. (Although the latter is way more interesting than the former, I would say.)</p>
<p><em>I</em> need to chose the final project. Likely, that project is something that I&rsquo;m already working on. I need to define my own goals. And likely, I need to figure something out <em>now</em>. I need just-in-time guidance; not something that we&rsquo;ll get to Week 7 of the syllabus.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Welcome to how everyone learns to code, Audrey.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>And okay, yeah. Sure. I get that. But that sorta indifferent shrug and a weekly email newsletter make for a pretty discouraging Code Year for a lot of folks.</p>
