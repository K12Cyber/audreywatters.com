<p><em>I&#8217;m starting a new feature here, <a href="https://www.edtechstrategies.com/in-the-news/">one I am absolutely ripping off from Doug Levin</a>, in which I highlight the media in which I&#8217;m cited.</em></p>

<p>As quoted in &#8220;Citing Investor Priorities, AltSchool Closes Some Sites, Pivots to Software Sales,&#8221; <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2017/11/AltSchool_investors_closes_sites_software_Sales.html?cmp=soc-twitter-shr">by Education Week&#8217;s Ben Herold</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many such ventures &#8220;involve grand experimentation on students in order to develop and sell products to other schools,&#8221; said Audrey Watters, an independent researcher who maintains the popular Hack Education blog. </p>
<br />
<p>&#8220;So much of what these companies do is really for their investors, and that really dictates the kinds of decisions that get made,&#8221; Watters said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It also raises bigger questions about AltSchool&#8217;s values and priorities, said Watters of Hack Education.</p>
<br />
<p>&#8220;When you think about schooling as a business, you don&#8217;t always recognize that you&#8217;re not dealing with products, you&#8217;re dealing with other people&#8217;s children,&#8221; she said.</p>
<br />
<p>That&#8217;s particularly true, Watters maintained, when companies feel beholden to venture capitalists expecting them to bring products to scale quickly.</p>
