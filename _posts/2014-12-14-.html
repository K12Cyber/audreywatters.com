<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>I signed a book contract! <em>Reclaim Your Domain: Building Learner Centered Technologies</em>, which will be published by Solution Tree. (It&rsquo;s not <em>Teaching Machines</em>, poor project, which always seems to get shuffled to a later date.)</li>
<li><a href="http://boundary2.org/2014/12/10/teacher-wars-and-teaching-machines/">My review of Dana Goldstein&rsquo;s new book</a> was republished on Boundary 2.</li>
<li>Model View Culture published a piece by me on the &ldquo;<a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/ed-tech-year-in-review">Ed-Tech Year in Review</a>&rdquo;</li>
<li>I participated in a year-end webinar for ELI, along with Michael Feldstein and Phil Hill.</li>
<li>I talked to Erik Shonstrom, who is working on a book on learning and curiosity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>At the end of every year, I always take stock in the technologies that I use, the ones I no longer use. (I update my passwords, etc in the process.) If there is a theme to 2014, it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ve ditched a lot of apps. I no longer use Foursquare. I no longer use Facebook. And this week, following a series of increasingly bloated updates, I&rsquo;m leaving Evernote too. I&rsquo;ve been a paid user since May 2010, but it&rsquo;s time to move on. I&rsquo;ve exported all my files, storying most of them in Dropbox. I&rsquo;ve moved a lot of notes to GitHub.</p>
<p>I signed up for Blocktogether; it joins Blockbot as crucial Twitter apps. Heh, I have some 3500 people blocked on Twitter now, which is probably one of the things that&rsquo;s helped me not quit Twitter this year. And speaking of Twitter, I took ThinkUp for a test drive. The insights it emails are neat, and I like to support the work of folks like Gina Trapani and Anil Dash &ndash; so I ponied up for a membership.</p>
<h2>Random</h2>
<p>25 years ago this week, I saw Alice Cooper play at Wembley Stadium. It remains one of the greatest rock shows I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And the encore of &ldquo;School&rsquo;s Out&rdquo; my first religious experience.</p>
