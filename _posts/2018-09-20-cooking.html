<p>I&#8217;ve been baking a bit this week &#8211; not sure what&#8217;s gotten into me. And I wanted to jot down the recipes so I have them on hand (in case something happens to the sites where I found them, if nothing else. I did just buy some index cards, so in the future I&#8217;ll be committing this all to paper.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of sweet things, which is too bad because I&#8217;m a pretty decent baker. So one sweet and one savory snack:</p>

<p><strong>Molasses Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
<li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar, for rolling</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat over to 325 degrees. Mix together the wet and then add the dry ingredients &#8211; come on, you know how to make cookies. Shape the dough into balls &#8211; about one rounded tablespoon per cookie &#8211; and roll in the granulated sugar. Bake for 15 minutes.</p>

<p><em>Note to self</em>: next time, double the ground ginger.</p>

<p><strong>Crispy Roasted Chickpeas</strong></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 cans of chickpeas</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>2 to 4 teaspoons spice (e.g. curry powder, cayenne)</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat over to 400. Rinse and drain and dry the chickpeas thoroughly. I mean thoroughly. Place on a baking sheet and toss with the olive oil and salt. Bake for 30 minutes, shaking pan every 10 minutes. Season after they&#8217;re out of the oven.</p>

<p><em>>Note to self</em>: next time, increase the oven temperature. Seasoning that works well: curry powder.</p>
