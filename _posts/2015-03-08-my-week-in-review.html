<h3>Travel (and Speaking)</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I traveled to Washington DC for 48 hours. Thankfully I was able to escape as the storm hit on Thursday morning.</li>
<li>Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach. Fingers crossed: no more travel until the end of April.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I sent off the manuscript of <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>. (One of this week&#8217;s task: revisions.)</li>
<li>I went to DC to interview New America Foundation&#8217;s Kevin Carey about the publication of his new book <em>The End of College</em>.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://audrey.sf.fedwikihappening.net/view/welcome-visitors">Teaching Machines Federated Wiki Happening</a> is happening. We held Google Hangouts on Friday and Saturday.</li>
<li>I had a quick run-through of a talk I&#8217;ve delivering virtually to Leeds University next week.</li>
<li>I had a wonderful call with Stephen Turnipseed from Lego Education, part of my research into the history of ed-tech (in this case, the history of Mindstorms).</li>
<li>I met Sam Chaltain for coffee while I was in DC.</li>
<li>I drafted a review of <em>The End of College</em>. Publication and co-authors TBD.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I picked Liz Losh&#8217;s <em>The War on Learning</em> up again.</li>
<li>I started Jill Lepore&#8217;s <em>The Secret History of Wonder Woman</em> (thanks in part to a connection that Kate Bowles made in the FedWiki happening, linking intelligence testing and machines to William Moulton Marston &#8211; the inventor of the lie detector and the creator of Wonder Woman).</li>
<li>I watched the <em>Mockingjay, Part 1</em>. This breaking books into multiple movies thing is bullshit.</li>
</ul>
