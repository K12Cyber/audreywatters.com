<p>Kin and I saw the new Star Wars movie last night. With the exception of the first movie back in 1977, I&rsquo;ve seen all of the films on opening day. (I saw Episode IV at the <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/824">Cooper Theatre</a> in Denver, but not on opening day. It was a magnificent Cinerama theater that, unfortunately, no longer exists.) I was six. That movie and its sequels provided the storylines for much of my imagination, for much of my childhood play.</p>
<p>It's something I wanted to share with my son. When The Phantom Menace came out, Isaiah was five. Our tickets were for a morning show, and I had to pull him out of school. His kindergarten teacher was so rude, challenging my priorities and decision-making. I remember sitting through Episode 1, so disappointed in the movie but so doubtful too of my own parenting decisions.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be excited about The Force Awakens. But there&rsquo;s something about that John Williams soundtrack. There&rsquo;s something about those characters. I was swept away, and I admit, I was a little emotional as the opening credits came on screen.</p>
<p>The movie is good. It&rsquo;s not great. But it&rsquo;s good. I remember my first reaction to news that George Lucas had sold the Star Wars franchise to Disney was disgust. But Lucas had been such a terrible steward of the story. How could Disney be any worse, I eventually came to believe. And that&rsquo;s what I felt last night: JJ Abrams was a better steward and storyteller. He certainly gave us better dialogue, and the characters &ndash; new and familiar &ndash; were pretty well-developed. I cared about them in ways I never cared about anyone in Episodes 1 through 3. Hell, those movies made me dislike Obi Wan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to write any spoilers, but there&rsquo;s a scene near the end of Episode VII that made the heart of childhood me explode with joy. It&rsquo;s something I wish I&rsquo;d had as a girl growing up with IV, V, and VI. It&rsquo;s something I wish were in the movies that Isaiah saw as a kid too. As someone who loves science fiction but has come in the last few decades to really resent Star Wars, I am very thankful that what I watched last night gave me back something to love.</p>
