<p>My granny passed away today, just a few days after her 98th birthday.</p>

<p>The last few weeks were quite difficult &#8211; she had a heart attack, pneumonia, and a pulmonary edema; the last few years perhaps even more so, as she suffered at times from dementia. She was certain that, of all her 10 grandchildren, <em>I</em> was sneaking into her room, stealing her remote control, sleeping in her bed, messing up her knitting. That&#8217;s a weirdly awful position to find oneself in, even if it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;about me.&#8221; Family tried to reassure her that I was halfway around the world, in California and not in Surrey. She wrote me a couple of rambling letters, thinking that I was coming to visit her and that she&#8217;d missed me because she was out in the garden. </p>

<p>I always sort of dreaded her letters. She wrote me many over the years, most admonishing me for the things she perceived I did wrong &#8211; getting pregnant, getting a PhD. My granny, I bet everyone in the family will attest, was something of A Letter Writer.</p>

<p>We had a strange relationship, Granny and I. I spent a lot of time in England growing up, and the two years I went to high school there, she was in effect my guardian. </p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t agree on much, and mostly it didn&#8217;t matter. Sometimes I feared her, and sometimes I ignored her. But truly, I loved her.</p>

<p>She represented, in my childhood imagination, England. She was Thatcher-esque, in some ways, in politics and austerity. But she was family. (And she was never, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/09/russell-brand-margaret-thatcher">as Russell Brand&#8217;s powerful obituary of Thatcher recalled</a>, left unloved or alone.) Granny could be stern, even prickly &#8211; it was partially her personality, partially her accent, partially her title. That's at least how I, as an American child, read the signals. (My dad never ever called her &#8220;Betty&#8221; incidentally, always insisting on the more formal &#8220;Lady Pretty.&#8221;)</p>

<p>I admired her tenacity with the daily crossword puzzle and her fierceness in Scrabble. She made a strangely delicious fish pie. She had wild strawberries in her garden, which I preferred to her strawberry jam. She always kept dark covered chocolate biscuits in the cupboard. She took me to France, and she took me to Scotland.</p>

<p>She took me in; she led me out.</p>

<p>One time when I visiting her for a weekend away from school, I was brushing my teeth late at night, and I heard a scratching sound above my head. I jabbed my toothbrush up at the ceiling in her cottage, and it went clean through, unleashing thousands and thousands of wasps which were nesting in her roof. I had to wake Granny up &#8211; challenging since she didn&#8217;t sleep with her hearing aids in &#8211; and we had to barricade ourselves in her bedroom to sleep that night as the house was infested with angry, stinging, buzzying insects.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I ever apologized. I am certain that later, we laughed again and again about that story. We laughed quite a bit, considering that she was, by most accounts, quite proper. I inherited from her this tendency to get the giggles and then completely unravel into uncontrollable tears of laughter. (I did not inherit "proper." Her title - "Lady Pretty" - was awarded, not inherited after all.)</p>

<p>Her father, I should note, worked in sweets.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pretty">her husband</a>, my mom's dad, my grandfather. He died when I was only three. I was, as most people my age find themselves, the grandchild of the &#8220;greatest generation.&#8221; If they were &#8220;the greatest,&#8221; we were always left to feel, I suppose, necessarily a bit less. That generation lost a lot, I realize. (And for what it&#8217;s worth, all my cousins, all her grandchildren and great grandchildren are amazing.)</p>

<p>I only knew Granny as a widow. I didn&#8217;t expect to be widowed early in life either, but I learned from Granny how you must truly seize life. </p>

<p>And, here today, I learn again how to know when to let go. I&#8217;m not sure Granny always understood that in her letter-writing, truth be told, or in her sometimes domineering oversight of her children and grandchildren. But in her own personal life, I think, she did. Sometimes you have to sigh and admit it is, as they say, simply for the best. </p>
