<p>I was a guest on Episode 10 of the <a href="https://anchor.fm/sowevebeenthinking">So We&#8217;ve Been Thinking</a> podcast, where I chatted with hosts Shawn McCusker and Greg Kulowiec on the history of education technology. We also chatted about behaviorism, surveillance, labor, the promise of automation, and the continued insistence that students do ridiculously pointless assignments.</p>
