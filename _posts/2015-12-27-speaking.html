<p>In previous years, I've written a review of my years "in numbers," counting the number of keynotes, the number of cities I visited, the number of bands I've seen, etc. I need to write my year in words and tears instead this year. Nonetheless I'll make note of some of those numbers here.</p>
<p><strong>Other speaking engagements</strong>:</p>
<p>A panel at API Strategy and Practice. A webinar with Alan Levine on Connected Learning TV. A webinar with Bryan Alexander on "Developments in Higher Education Educational Technology: The Horizon Report in Action." A workshop at ICDE. A workshop at the Digital Pedagogy Lab. A guest appearance on TWIT.tv.</p>
