<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I submitted an application for a Shuttleworth Fellowship. (You can read part of it above.)</li>
<li>I added an Archive page to <a href="http://hackeducation.com/archives.html">Hack Education</a> and <a href="http://audreywatters.com/archives.html">audreywatters.com</a>.</li>
<li>I updated the <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a> website to reflect my series on the history of the future of ed-tech.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m using Known more and more and moved my site to a new domain, <a href="http://aud.life">aud.life</a>.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve started working on my talk for Wednesday (virtually) at WOU.</li>
<li>I finalized the citations on my article for Routledge. (I&#8217;ve got to make some final edits before it&#8217;s complete.)</li>
<li>I hung out with folks from #TieGrad on Tuesday night, discussing gender and ed-tech.</li>
<li>I had an email interview with Rob Berger, to be published (I think) in the new <a href="http://edcircuit.com">Ed Circuit</a>.</li>
<li>I ditched Asana and moved my To Do list over to Wunderlist. I&#8217;m not thrilled with it as it seems to have problems syncing between the Mac app and the iPhone app. (Why does everyone rave about Wunderlist so much?!)</li>
<li>I did the end-of-the-month invoicing and updates to my CV and websites.</li>
<li>I backed De La Soul&#8217;s album on Kickstarter.</li>
<li>I chatted with Bobbi Newman about a project she&#8217;s working on.</li>
<li>I chatted with Medium&#8217;s Gabe Kleinman about Medium-related writing.</li>
<li>I am so tired of requests for bios and headshots, so I added an &#8220;about.json&#8221; file to audreywatters.com. (Wishful thinking, I know).</li>
<li>I was terrible about exercising during March, but I&#8217;m back at the gym daily now. I&#8217;m also on the wagon for the month of April.</li>
<li>I tried to join ResearchGate but was told I didn&#8217;t count as a real scholar. Emails were exchanged. I&#8217;m now on ResearchGate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I finished <em>The War on Learning</em> (and asked for an extension on the review I&#8217;m writing).</li>
<li>I finished <em>The Emerald City of Oz</em> and started <em>The Patchwork Girl of Oz</em>.</li>
<li>We watched <em>Interstellar</em>. Meh.</li>
<li>I started reading <em>Words Onscreen</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Our friend Steve Willmott has been here with us in Hermosa this weekend. It was an opportunity to try Dia de Campo, a restaurant we hadn&#8217;t eaten at yet.</li>
<li>The kid will be here next weekend, and I cannot wait.</li>
