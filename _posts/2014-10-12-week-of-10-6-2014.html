<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>Nope. Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach, then Stockholm.</p>
<h2>Family and Friends</h2>
<p>EML co-founder Bruce Dixon stopped by briefly en route back to Australia and we went out for dinner. And our friend Mehdi Medjaoui came down from San Francisco with his girlfriend and spent the weekend with us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a reminder that Kin and I should travel less, and folks should just come visit us here in Hermosa Beach.</p>
<h2>Hack Education Writing</h2>

<h2>Reading and Viewing</h2>
<p>As I find being annoyed about spoilers annoying &ndash; particularly if the book&rsquo;s been published for a while, I read <em>Gone Girl</em>. So no complaining from me about movie reviews that spoil the book. I started reading <em>The Innovators</em>, which I&rsquo;m finding annoying for other reasons.</p>
<p>We rented Tom Cruise&rsquo;s latest movie, <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, which we actually watched twice and both times I stopped paying attention about halfway through. Sorry, Tom.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I recorded an episode of the Teaching in Higher Ed podcast with Bonni Stachowiak. (<a href="http://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/technology-changing-higher-education/">Recording is available here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://inquiryschools.org/">Inquiry Schools</a> had its board meeting. (I&rsquo;m on the board. Note to self: add this to the <a href="/disclosures/">disclosures page</a> on this site.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working on all my upcoming talks for November, as well as planning for my annual year-end blog posts. What are the <a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/">top 10 ed-tech trends of 2014</a>? 1) BS. 2) Hype. 3) Exploitation. 4) Surveillance&hellip; (I kid, I kid. Sorta.)</p>
<p>Mostly, this week sucked. #Gamergate rages on, with <a href="http://bbs.boingboing.net/t/yet-another-female-game-dev-targeted-with-credible-threats-after-speaking-out-on-sexism/42806/22">another woman</a> in gaming being chased out of her home. The Grace Hopper Celebration decided to invite a panel of &ldquo;<a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/10/09/technology-sexism-male-allies-grace-hopper-celebration">male allies</a>&rdquo; to talk about fixing sexism in tech (panel members included the CEO of GoDaddy, known best perhaps for its sexist advertising campaigns), and reports from the event suggested the panel was &ldquo;worse than expected&rdquo;. At the same event, <a href="http://readwrite.com/2014/10/09/nadella-women-dont-ask-for-raise">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</a> said that women shouldn&rsquo;t ask for raises; they should trust &ldquo;karma.&rdquo; Tech educator Kathy Sierra deleted her Twitter account (@seriouspony), leaving behind a really chilling <a href="http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point">blog post</a> (<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win/">Wired version</a>) about her ongoing experiences with harassment and trolling. In response, <a href="https://storify.com/adriarichards/telling-my-troll-story-because-kathy-sierra-left-t">Adria Richards shared</a> some of her experiences with violent threats and harassment as well. My online run-in with someone this week was minor in comparison, but still&hellip; I can't work like this. I can't write like this...</p>
