<p><strong>How I go to the woods</strong></p>

<p>Ordinarily, I go to the woods alone, with not a single friend, for they are all smilers and talkers and therefore unsuitable.</p>

<p>I don't really want to be witnessed talking to the catbirds or hugging the old black oak tree. I have my way of praying, as you no doubt have yours.</p>

<p>Besides, when I am alone I can become invisible. I can sit on the top of a dune as motionless as an uprise of weeds, until the foxes run by unconcerned. I can hear the almost unhearable sound of the roses singing.</p>

<p>If you have ever gone to the woods with me, I must love you very much.</p>

<p>~ Mary Oliver</p>
