<p>In addition to working on an article on the history of virtual reality in education and a <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2016/02/25/blockchain-edu1">research project on the future of the blockchain in education</a>, I&rsquo;ve got these topics on the back burner:</p>
<ul>
<li>The history of E-Rate. Who pushed for this? Who benefited? What might this history teach us about today&rsquo;s ed-tech policy pushes?</li>
<li>The histories of the military and ed-tech. This is, of course, connected with VR and simulation. But I&rsquo;d like to write something about the history of SCORM, including its most recent manifestation, xAPI.</li>
<li>The history/politics of DonorsChoose. I&rsquo;m curious: What percentage of projects go buying tech? How much of an increase in taxes paid by tech companies would it take to pay for this? What does the popularity of DonorsChoose tell us about procurement and funding?</li>
<li>The history of the dot edu top level domain. I&rsquo;ve inquired at Educause about this but no one seems to know the history. (?!?!)</li>
<li>An ed-tech-focused history of Montessori.</li>
<li>The history of TurnItIn. I'm interested more broadly in ed-tech innovations that get spun out of universities. But in the case of TurnItIn, I'd like to look at technology, cheating fears, and student IP.</li>
<li>David Horowitz, Ben Horowitz, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Politics of Software Eating Education.</li>
<li>A history of PLATO. This is the section that's really still lacking for <em>Teaching Machines</em>. So honestly, it needs to be first on this list.</li>
</ul>
