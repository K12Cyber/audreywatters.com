<p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/robotics/industrial-robots/zume-the-robotic-pizza-company-makes-a-pizza-only-a-robot-could-love">From IEEE Spectrum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zume, the robotic pizza maker, is now valued at more than US $2 billion, thanks to its latest round of investment. According to The Wall Street Journal, this latest infusion of funds &#8211; $375 million &#8211;came entirely from SoftBank; and the Japanese conglomerate apparently has another $375 million at the ready should Zume need it. The valuation, in Silicon Valley terms, makes the new company a unicorn, one of the rare breed of startups thought to be worth over $1 billion.</p>
<br />
<p>This is just wrong. Because it&#8217;s just not good pizza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is such a perfect little encapsulation of venture capital and technology startups: the quality of the product is shit, but investors insist it&#8217;s &#8220;innovative&#8221; and as such bound to be lucrative.</p>

<p>In this case, someone somewhere read a SF novel in which robots made and delivered pizza. The pizza in that novel was probably lousy too &#8211; entrepreneurs tend to struggle with reading comprehension, I find, and fail to notice or understand the criticisms that writers inject in their prose. (You know the type &#8211; the ones that insist that <em>Diamond Age</em> and <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em> serve as ringing endorsements of artificial intelligence in education.) Robot-made pizzas are a fast food of <em>dystopian</em> fiction &#8211; a world in which flavor has been sacrificed for gadgetry, in which slow, simmering sauces are replaced with a red ooze that a mechanical hand can speedily squeeze out as the cardboard crusts roll by.</p>

<p>Who wants to eat this way?</p>

<p>Food can serve as a resistance to standardization and automation. Or good cooking can, at least. But good cooking &#8211; like good teaching &#8211; won&#8217;t come from a robot. A robot will never care enough to do it right.</p>
