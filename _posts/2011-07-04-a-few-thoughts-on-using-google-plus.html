<p><img class="alignleft" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/googleplus150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />I felt somewhat late to the plussing party as I was at <a href="http://isteconference.org">ISTE 2011</a> when <a href="plus.google.com">Google+</a> was launched on Tuesday.  I got an early invite (Thanks, <a href="http://marshallk.com/">Marshall</a>), but didn't even log in until my flight back to the west coast late Wednesday night (Thanks, in-air WiFi). (Sidenote: how bizarre that I feel like a late early adopter of G+ because I didn't check it out in the first 24 hours.)  No doubt because I was headed back from a 22K educator event, my initial thoughts have been about how Google+ could work for teachers and students.</p>

<p>My first reaction: It has great potential. My worries: widespread adoption and Web filtering.  You can read my RWW write-up <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_plus_education.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>What I didn't really address in that piece were my trepidations about relocating <i><b>my</b></i> education-oriented and tech-oriented social networks elsewhere -- namely from Twitter to Google+.  I follow hundreds of educators and techies on Twitter.  I just rolled over my 5000th Twitter follower.  Must I relocate that all to Google+?</p>

<p>Well, no. I needn't.  New network means, well, new network.  People will come to Google+ or they won't.  I'll build a network there or I won't.  I needn't replicate Twitter or Facebook or even my Gmail contacts list there.  It's still early (it's still just a "field trial), and even though some of the louder voices in tech are full of high praise for the site, that doesn't mean it's going to necessarily be a hit.</p>

<p>But damn, I like it. I see how G+ could easily be a hit at last for a social effort from Google.  It has offers a lot of things that I really like:  a nice UI, granular controls for sharing, video chat, messaging, photos, and a notification system that, because I'm an avid user of Google's suite of tools (Gmail, Reader, Docs), is hard to ignore.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by this new network, particularly in what it means in terms of sharing, and I'm already seeing some of the new and different ways -- as a family member, as a journalist, as an ed-techie, etc -- I'll be able to communicate by having a particular Circle as my interlocutors.  Heck, I got my mom to join, as it's perfect for the sharing she already does via Picasa (She's not on Facebook). </p> 

<p>It feels quite conversational on Google+ so far, but like I said, it's early. We haven't all hooked up auto-posting and moved along, continuing to push our updates primarily to Facebook and Twitter.  And as it stands, I'd wager a good three-quarters of the posts on Google+ are about the service itself. (The rest is Sergey Brin's photos.)</p>

<p>Some random thoughts:</p>
<ul class="mainlist"><li><b>G+ versus Facebook.</b>  Facebook has already lost the battle for my time and interest.  I rarely visit the site, and even less rarely share things there.  I've tried to convince Facebook friends to check out Twitter, where up 'til the launch of Google+, I spent most of my social networking energies, but most of them have viewed Twitter with suspicion and hostility.  And at this stage, I just don't feel like evangelizing Google+ (or Twitter, quite frankly.  Don't get me started there) to that Facebook crowd.  I've already moved <i>my</i> social efforts away from Facebook, with the knowledge that if I desperately need to know what's happening with the members of my high school graduating class, I know where I can find them.</li><br/>
<li><b>Broadcasting</b>:  Sharing links is probably 85% of what I do on Twitter (most of it links to my writing), and I don't think -- for now -- that my behavior on Twitter will change.  But I haven't decided yet what my broadcast strategy will be for Google+.  I hated that sense with Buzz that everything there was simply an aggregation of things posted elsewhere.  Will I post all my links to Google+?  (I haven't so far.)  Will I post them as public, or will I post them only to certain Circles?  <b>How will this targeted and limited method of sharing change how information is spread?</b> (I ask that in terms of journalism and in terms of education.)</li><br/>
<li><b>Sparks</b>:  So far, Sparks is the least fleshed out of Google+'s features.  I haven't been terribly impressed with the content that it's uncovered for the few topics I've selected (education technology, e-books, libraries, and open source), but I haven't tried following the suggested topics like sports cars or recipes.  Go figure.  Sparks could be interesting (and ugh, that seems to be the gist of a lot of my review of G+ -- "the potential" -- ah, how it reminds me of my thoughts about Wave.)</li><br/>
<li><b>Google Reader</b>:  And speaking of feeds, what will happen to Google Reader?  Will I be able to easily share to Google+?  I'd like that a lot, and I'd probably share that way before even Tweeting a link quite honestly.  And again, I love the idea of being able to share with just certain folks (as those who follow me on Google Reader know, I share a lot of Star Wars stuff, something that I can now spare you from).  Of course, Google Reader doesn't have so I'm curious to see how or if it's actually integrated into the G+ fold.  [Insert "death of RSS" claim here]</li><br/>
<li><b>+1 Button</b>:  I haven't added the +1 button to this blog and to <a href="http://hackeducation">Hack Education</a>.  I guess that's on the To-Do list now, even though I have serious button fatigue and even though I'm not clear where "plussing" will fit in -- as a social action or for social search.</li><br/>
