<p>I'm working on a talk I'll give next week at Davidson College, in which I use Wonder Woman to highlight the "golden lasso" that ed-tech has us in -- this subtext of domination, compliance, and submission that run through ed-tech (and, of course, Wonder Woman). We call it liberation, but the power relations are more complex than that...</p>

<p>Also, Wonder Woman's creator, William Moulton Marston, was a student of education psychology, alongside Thorndike et al. This is behaviorism popularized and mechanized, in teaching machines and lassos of truth...</p>
