<h2>Travel &amp; Speaking</h2>
<p>I spent a little over half the week in Hermosa Beach and the rest traveling to and from and briefly being in Atlanta for ISTE. Well, specifically I was there for <a href="http://www.isteunplugged.com/fri-627-hack-education.html">EduBloggerCon (aka #HackEd14)</a>. It&rsquo;s often described as the best part of the conference (thank you Steve Hargadon!) &ndash; an unconference held the day before the actual event kicks off. Attendees decide the topics for conversations, and we have just that: conversations. No keynotes. No panels. No powerpoints.</p>
<p>I proposed and facilitated two conversations: one on &ldquo;Ed-Tech and Equity (Race, Class, Gender)&rdquo; and one on &ldquo;Data and Privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have to admit, being at ISTE was incredibly difficult, particularly as I&rsquo;ve been trying to hold the organization and its attendees <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/06/04/yesallwomen-iste-code-of-conduct/">accountable</a> for addressing a culture/community that is becoming increasingly exclusionary, if not outright dangerous, for marginalized people and voices. I&rsquo;m very grateful to everyone who came up to me and thanked me for my work. I&rsquo;m very grateful to know that I have <a href="https://twitter.com/jcasap/status/482743655694745600">dear friends and solid allies</a> in ed-tech. But there were a number of interactions (including some non-interactions &ndash; refusals to talk to me or even look at me &ndash; from folks I thought were friends) that were pretty hurtful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of work to do in the ed-tech community to address power and privilege, and I&rsquo;m amazed to see how many are seemingly adamant that we do nothing, lest it upset their own personal privilege or (grosser) their popularity. Wow. Duly noted.</p>

<h2>Reading &amp; Viewing</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started (re)reading Katherine Hayles&rsquo; book <em>How We Became Posthuman: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature, and Informatics</em>.</p>
<p>I watched <em><a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/internetsownboy/94238859">The Internet&rsquo;s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz</a></em> (and watched it with such a heavy, heavy heart).</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>Despite the emotional hell that was attending ISTE, I feel like this was a pretty good week for my work. See, I was mentioned twice on OLDaily (<a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/62430">1</a>, <a href="http://www.downes.ca/post/62447">2</a>) and <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2014/dont-personalize-learning/">once</a> on Dan Meyer&rsquo;s blog, and I was interviewed by NPR&rsquo;s Anya Kamenetz on <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/ed/2014/06/27/323329818/chasing-the-elusive-quality-in-online-education">a story</a> on &ldquo;quality&rdquo; and online education. Also David Wiley published the new <a href="http://openedconference.org/2014/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> for Open Education 2014, a project he and I collaborated on.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p><a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin</a> is back in Hermosa. He&rsquo;s returned with his daughter who&rsquo;ll be staying with us for the next few weeks.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And one final note</span>: I&rsquo;m weighing closing my Facebook account, in light of this <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/facebook-tinkered-users-feeds-massive-psychology-e-206324">grossly unethical experiment</a> it conducted. I&rsquo;m not a huge Facebook fan, but there are a few folks, including family members and old friends that I&rsquo;m not in contact with outside of it. Me, I&rsquo;m easy to keep up with elsewhere on the Internet. There&rsquo;s this blog, for starters. There&rsquo;s <a href="http://twitter.com/audreywatters">Twitter</a>. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just start sending handwritten letters again. That worked for a long, long time to keep us informed about our lives, didn&rsquo;t it.</p>
