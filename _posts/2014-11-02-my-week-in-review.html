<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I finished up a piece for DigiWriMo (which should be published soon), and I worked on my upcoming talks at Pepperdine and NYU. Mozilla&rsquo;s new publication The Open Standard republished an excerpt from Hack Education Weekly News, &ldquo;<a href="https://openstandard.mozilla.org/yes-gamergate-is-a-ed-tech-issue/">Yes, #Gamergate is an Ed-Tech Issue</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made all the travel arrangements for my upcoming trips this month: New York, Washington DC, Fredricksburg, etc.</p>
<p>As it was the end of the month, I did the obligatory invoicing, following-up on old invoices, and updating of the ol&rsquo; CV.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I read Astra Taylor&rsquo;s <em>The People&rsquo;s Platform</em> and started William Gibson&rsquo;s <em>The Peripheral</em>.</p>
<h2>Family and Friends</h2>
<p>Kin and I celebrated our fifth anniversary yesterday. I am so happy, so in love, so lucky.</p>

<p>And The Kid enrolled in school &ndash; he&rsquo;ll start a phlebotomy course in January.</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
