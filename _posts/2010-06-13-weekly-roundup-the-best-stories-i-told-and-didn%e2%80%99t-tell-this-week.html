<p>Holy crap, what a week!</p>
<p>I penned around thirty blog posts, here and <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">there</a>, at <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com">this</a> <a href="http://www.zendesk.com/blog">place</a> and <a href="http://www.justmeans.com">that</a>.  I'm done rit out.</p>
<p>So lemme summarize:  The word of the week was "<strong>cloud</strong>," as I took on a new writing assignment for RWW's cloud computing channel, as I wrote about <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/06/the-ultimate-liner-notes-uk-st.php">Decibel</a> the "semantic cloud-based relational database of music" (pretty much the coolest thing ever for a music fan), and as Kin had happy-fun-zen-times with AWS, <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/06/impermanence-and-the-cloud/">except not really</a>.</p>
<p>Or maybe the word of the week was "<strong>school</strong>."  I wrote a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/06/a-college-student-and-a-ceo-a.php">profile</a> of a 21-year-old college student/entrepreneur, I wrote about the Google Apps for Education versus the Microsoft Live@edu <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/06/the-battle-for-cloud-based-edu.php">battle</a>, and I wrote <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/googles_new_secure_search_might_force_schools_to_b.php">something</a> that got me my first <a href="http://www.techmeme.com">Techmeme</a> hit (and my first angry email from Google PR), a story about Google's new Secure Search and some unintended consequences with its impact on schools' web filtering.  In other school news, Isaiah finished his junior year this week. (Rock on.)  He also turned 17. (Holy shit.)</p>
<p>Or, the word of the week could be "<strong>community</strong>"--relationships, networks, affinities, loyalties.  I've been thinking a lot this week about how if my life hadn't changed so amazingly-for-the-better, this time of year I'd be in crazy/crazed preparations to head to <a href="http://center.uoregon.edu/ISTE/2010/">ISTE 2010</a> as someone running 30ish events (OMFG!).  I'm a little sad to be missing out on the conference--it's really great to get to see educators energized over technology and professional development.  (And it's really great to see old friends.)  Along those lines, I've also been thinking about "community" in terms of a story I didn't write this week:   the implications of the Linden Labs layoffs.  (Read <a href="http://scottsecondlife.blogspot.com/2010/06/linden-lab-layoffs-what.html">Scott Merrick</a> instead.)  And I've also been thinking about "community" in terms of what makes the tech industry a "<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2010/06/ncwit-report-examines-womens-d.php">boys club</a>" and what we can do to disrupt that.  I certainly don't think ending <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=988">anonymity</a> online is the answer.  I don't think filtering is the answer.</p>
<p>Smart folks in the tech industry and smart teachers helping our kids figure out our digital future are sure part of the answer, though, and I am damn lucky to get to work with a lot of 'em.</p>
