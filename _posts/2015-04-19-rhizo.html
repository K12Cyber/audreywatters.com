<ul>
<li>There is no such thing as objectivity. What we know and say and see is always partial, situated. As a writer and researcher, I try to make well-reasoned claims, but they are never not subjective.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t always know where my research will take me when I set out (although I do have a pretty good idea).</li>
<li>I have a pretty good idea where my research will take me because (a) I&rsquo;ve done a lot of research (b) on education technology.</li>
<li>Sometimes I know what I want to write; sometimes I figure it out as I write. It&rsquo;s harder to write if I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I want to say.</li>
<li>Writing is always difficult. I&rsquo;m a writer, but some days I have to force myself to do write.</li>
<li>I make To Do lists rather obsessively. I procrastinate if I don&rsquo;t have a clear deadline. (I sometimes invent tasks and deadlines for myself.) If it&rsquo;s not on the To Do list, it doesn&rsquo;t get done. e.g., email.</li>
<li>I work for myself, so I have to keep myself on track. No one else will. <strong>I know this about myself</strong>.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m very &ldquo;goal oriented,&rdquo; particularly as that phrase is typically used. I don&rsquo;t care about wealth or fame. I sure do like ticking items off my To Do list.</li>
<li>What is a task? What is a goal? What is an objective? How are these different? How might we confuse these (in learning as in life), in part because tasks fit neatly onto a list? Tasks on To Do lists tend to be quite concrete and perhaps more easily accomplished. I feel accomplished when I complete a task on my To Do list.</li>
<li>Feeling accomplished &ndash; is that subjective? Or objective?</li>
<li>Who has the freedom to decide what to work on? What to learn?</li>
<li>Rank these in order of power and privilege: Object. Subject. Objective. Subjective. Objectivity. Subjectivity. Subject is (probably) first. Subjective is (arguably) last.</li>
<li>To claim objectivity smacks of privilege. Most of us are necessarily viewed as subjective. We are marked. The unmarked &ndash; the objective &ndash; is the often unmentioned adjective: white, male, heterosexual, able-bodied, from the Global North, etc.</li>
<li>There is power is getting to set the learning objectives.</li>
<li>To set the learning subjectives &ndash; is there an element of privilege there too? Who gets to stake these claims? Yes, sure. Ideally all of us do; all of us can; all of us could. Ideally.</li>
<li>Who can afford to do so? How do we make sure those affordances are available to everyone?</li>
