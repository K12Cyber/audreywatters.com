<p>I admit, I spend a lot of time trying out new productivity tools (a good indication of and reason for my lack of productivity perhaps). As there are three "computers" I use during my day -- my home PC, my work laptop, and my iPhone -- I try to ensure that any information I need -- files, contact information, calendars, etc -- is accessible no matter which one I'm using. Consequently, I look for tools that have both a web interface and a mobile application.</p>

<p>I'm in the market for a couple of new tools, as I'm not fully satisfied with the ones I use now for:</p>

<p>1) Calendar/Scheduling</p>

<p>2) To Do Lists</p>

<p>Why not use Google Calendar and Tasks? Well, I do, in part. I also cling to a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a> subscription that I really only use for (re)scheduling things like haircuts and therapy appointments (it's easy to just edit the entry's "due date" instead of creating a new appointment). But the multiple calendars and apps I use are annoying as... well, as there are multiple apps with multiple versions in multiple places.</p>

<p>This has long been compounded by the fact that the calendar I (am forced to) use for work doesn't integrate with anything other than my work computer. My job has long used Meeting Maker internally for meeting scheduling, which means I have to duplicate entries into my Google Calendar so that I don't inadvertently double-book myself (and I am in <em>a lot</em> of meetings). There's never been a way with Meeting Maker to easily invite those outside our organization to meetings, which has resulted in a lot of back-and-forth via emails, trying to find a suitable time for a conference call or what have you. However, my office is moving to an Exchange Server (I will not blog about IT, I will not blog about IT, I will not blog about IT, I will end this paragraph now), and we'll be using Outlook for meeting scheduling. And so I'm going to give <a href="http://tungle.me">Tungle</a> a try.</p>

<p>Tungle will sync my Google and Outlook calendars (and iCal or Entourage once I make that magical leap to a Mac), and it has an iPhone app. In addition to syncing my various calendars, it serves as a meeting scheduler. While they lose major cool points for having such an awful name, I'm going to see how it works. Expect a review soon!</p>
