<p>I recently asked The Internet to help me identify these woodcuts. My dad made them in his early twenties, when he was bedridden with a severely broken leg.</p>

<p>I recognized one &#8211; Sherlock Holmes &#8211; but I needed help identifying the others, and I was surprised with what I learned.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t recall him having any particular interest in German Expressionism, the style of three of these. I imagine now that there must have been a book at my grandparents&#8217; house from which he copied some of these: the works of Karl Schmidt Rottluff, Erich Heckel, Emil Nolde. </p>

<p>Was he attracted to Die Br√ºcke &#8211; its emotion, its violence, its primitivism? Or was he simply copying woodcuts as he made his own? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d remembered these pieces of art, which hung in my grandparents&#8217; house before they hung in my dad&#8217;s, quite differently than what they actually portray. I was certain, for example, the set contained an etching of Boris Karloff as Frankenstein&#8217;s monster and one of Lon Chaney. In part, it&#8217;s my failed recollection of what my dad had drawn; I wonder if he didn&#8217;t really recollect who the subjects were either.</p>

<p>And this is what has stuck with me. (Well, the pictures have too. I didn&#8217;t keep much from my dad&#8217;s house, but I did bring these six woodcuts home with me.) At one point his life, my dad wanted to be an artist of some sort &#8211; a cartoonist perhaps, or a musician. It was a dream of a teen, no doubt. But that&#8217;s the age when his brother had left home to become a writer; instead my dad stayed to work at the family grocery store. He was nevertheless an elaborate storyteller &#8211; it&#8217;s likely my dad did invent a tale about what he&#8217;d carved in these pictures. Why I remember these stories and woodcuts centered on the Universal Monsters, I don&#8217;t know but I can guess.</p>

<p>Sometimes we invent stories to cope; sometimes we invent stories to forget; sometimes the truth gets so foggy, imagination and invention are all that&#8217;s left. Sometimes we see monsters; and sometimes there really are monsters there.</p>
