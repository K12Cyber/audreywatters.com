<p>The first game I decided to try after installing the Humble Indie Bundle onto my new Macbook was <a href="http://amanita-design.net/samorost-2/">Samorost 2</a>. And it was playing the game that prompted me to write this (belated) review series on the bundle. Samorost 2 was immediately enjoyable -- visually, intellectually -- and I knew that I'd be addicted to helping the little gnome white rescue his dog and get his spaceship home. If I was going to write a series of reviews, I quickly realized I needed to put Samorost 2 aside and work my way through the other titles first. You know, save the best for last.</p>
<p>And after my really shoddy attempt at playing <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1163">Penumbra Overture</a> tonight, I felt like I needed to redeem myself -- not just in terms of my game-review skills but in terms of my love for simple point-and-click puzzle-solving games.</p>
<p>Like Penumbra Overture, Samorost 2 simply involves exploring the screen, trying to figure out what to click, what items can be moved and manipulated, what order items objects need to be activated. Like Penumbra Overture... but not really.</p>
<p>Unlike the dark, dull graphics of Penumbra Overture, Amanita Design's flash-based game is visually striking, full of strange creatures, bizarre plants, odd contraptions. The graphics are reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch (ok, minus the tortured souls) or the animated Terry Gilliam, perhaps. I hate the word "whimsical" because it sounds so goddamn cute, but really, you're a gnome.  You have to rescue your puppy.  You have to tickle flying walruses with giant feathery plants.  You have to lure a snail to sleep to steal its hammer.  You know, whimsical.</p>
<p>Samorost 2 is pretty simple.  There is no way to save the game -- you get a good ol' fashioned passcode for each level.  While some of the puzzles in Samorost 2 are fairly challenging, the game is pretty simple.  I mean, damn if I didn't just sit down and play through the whole thing start to finish.  And truthfully, I'm a little disappointed the game was so short.</p>
<p>But what a way to end my run through the Humble Indie Bundle games, eh.  The best for last:  I win.</p>
