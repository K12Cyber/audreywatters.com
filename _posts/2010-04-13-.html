I wonder if I'm the last of my friends playing <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=308" target="_blank">Fallen London</a>. The invitations to "loiter suspiciously" have all but dwindled away. It's fine, people! It's fine. I plan to do a little research on other Twitter-based games (although honestly, I sorta want to design one myself and call it <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/04/the-twitter-platform.html" target="_blank">Inflection Point</a>).<p></p>
I started playing the beta version of EA's <a href="http://www.lordofultima.com/" target="_blank">Lord of Ultima</a> today. (Yes, that Ultima. Except not really.) The browser-based game has its official launch next week. I don't have anything insightful to say about it yet. As you can see by the screenshot, I've got my town hall all the way to a whopping level 2!

According to promo materials, "Lord of Ultima is an online strategy game where you build your own unique city and play with thousands of other players. Join now and rule a mighty empire which you can access from wherever and whenever you want." Although I'm interested in browser-based games, particularly ones that don't involve Facebook (whatever! It's "research"!) I'm sorta "meh" about building a unique city or ruling a mighty empire. I think I'd rather be the marauding hero. I just hope I can kill other players.<p></p>
(Oh snap, are there Twitter-based player-versus-player RPGs?! I sense more the need for more "research.")
