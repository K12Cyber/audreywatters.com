<p>I don&rsquo;t think DeVos is going to get much done when it comes to any K&ndash;12 policy agenda that involves vouchers.</p>
<p>But this administration is going to come hard for higher ed. Our President, after all, ran a scam college. One of his closer education advisors is Jerry Falwell Jr, the head of Liberty University. Trump tweeted recently he wanted to withhold funding for UC Berkeley because there were protests against a white nationalist speaker.</p>
<p>The regulations that the Obama Administration put in place to curb the exploitative behaviors of for-profits will likely be rolled back. Coding bootcamps and MOOCs, the new for-profit higher ed, will become eligible for federal financial aid.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if there were attempts to privatize student loans. (DeVos was an investor in SoFi. Peter Thiel is an investor in SoFi and in several other student loan startups. Let&rsquo;s just note here that Edsurge &ndash; that dangerous piece of trash &ndash; refuses to discuss these startups because "they&rsquo;re not ed-tech.)</p>
<p>Privatization &ndash; through ed-tech &ndash; will be heavily, heavily pushed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a disaster.</p>
<p>The bright side: screwing over college students is not a smart plan &ndash; for governing, for re-election. And I don&rsquo;t just mean those young folks age 18&ndash;24-ish who stereotypically do not vote. I mean all of us with student loan debt. I mean vets. I mean parents. I mean exactly the people who flooded the Senate with calls and faxes and letters. People are drowning in student loan debt, and these rich assholes have made it clear they want us to drown.</p>
<p>Resist.</p>
