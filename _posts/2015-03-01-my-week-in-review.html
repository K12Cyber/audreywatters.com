<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>The manuscript for <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em> is due today. Yikes. I worked on the book all week, but I also worked on a lot of other stuff. Needless to say, today is a writing day.</li>
<li>I did most of my end-of-the-month invoicing and website/CV-updating.</li>
<li>I chatted with Karim Ani from Mathalicious, and I had a wonderful call with the folks at Apple who were really helpful with background info for my series on ed-tech history.</li>
<li>Sava Saheli Singh, Liana Silva, and I hung out to talk about how to use GitHub Pages to power one&#8217;s website. (I recorded three screencasts, explaining the steps. I wrote up the instructions <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2015/02/24/reclaim2/">here</a>.)</li>
<li>I joined a Master's level ed-course at the University of Michigan where the students interviewed me about experience and expertise.</li>
<li>The DML 2015 conference committee had a planning meeting. Notifications for acceptances should be out soon.</li>
<li>Friday was the final hangout for the #moocmooc. I joined Jesse Stommel, Maha Bali, Sean Morris, and Chris Friend to talk about Seymour Papert&#8217;s <em>Mindstorms</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I finished Rebecca Solnit&#8217;s <em>River of Shadows</em> and started and finished Rae Mariz&#8217;s <em>The Unidentified</em>.</li>
<li>We watched a bit of <em>Star Trek</em> this week, and I cried cried cried over the loss of Leonard Nimoy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve had our friend Jason H. here from Brooklyn for the weekend. I had breakfast with Diana L. on Saturday. I predict, if this horrid winter keeps up, we'll get even more visitors in LA.</li>
