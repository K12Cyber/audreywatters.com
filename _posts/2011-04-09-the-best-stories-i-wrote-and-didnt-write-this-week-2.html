My favorite (and most successful) story this week -- <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/what_do_kids_say_is_the_biggest_obstacle_to_techno.php">What Do Kids Say Is the Biggest Obstacle to Technology at School</a> -- looked at the <a href="http://www.tomorrow.org/speakup/speakup_reports.html">Speak Up 2010</a> survey, in which students did just that:  had a chance to speak up about how technology is (and isn't) being used for teaching and learning at their schools.  Their main beefs:  cellphone bans and Internet filters.<p></p>
I am a huge proponent of the mobile phone (and not the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/tag/tablet/">tablet</a>) as the tech tool we need to emphasize.  That survey seemed to indicate that parents agree, the vast majority saying they'd pay for a phone <em>and a data plan</em> for their kids if they could use them at school.  Um, hello.  That's parents saying they're willing to equip their kids with a pocket computer.  Let's make that happen.<p></p>
But instead we ban.  We ban the cellphone, and we erect these walls around the Internet on school campuses.  "For the sake of the children," of course.<p></p>
No doubt, filters are a huge obstacle for teachers and students -- something we don't talk about nearly enough.  ("We" -- whoever that is.)  Well, I talked about it several times this week, in a <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/04/students-complain-about-archaic-internet-blocking-rules/">follow-up story</a> I wrote about filtering for NPR's MindShift blog and <a href="http://mindshift.kqed.org/2011/04/eight-surprising-webites-schools-cant-access/">one</a> that I contributed some reporting to.<img class="alignright" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/writing.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="134" /><p></p>
As for the best stories I didn't write, well, tune in next week.  I have several I'm working on -- for RWW, for MindShift, and now to the latest place where you'll be able to find my writing: <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media's Radar</a> blog.<p></p>
