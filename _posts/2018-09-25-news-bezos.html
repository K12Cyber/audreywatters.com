<p>I&#8217;ve been cited in several stories about Jeff Bezos&#8217; plans to develop a chain of Montessori-inspired preschools as his first big foray into educational philanthropy:</p>

<ul>

<li>&#8220;<a href="https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/09/26/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-ambitious-pre-k-move.html">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&#8217; Ambitious Pre-K Move Sparks Wary Reactions</a>&#8221; also in Education Week</li>
<li>Larry Cuban also <a href="https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2018/09/24/its-like-amazon-but-for-preschool-audrey-watters/">republished my article</a> on the Bezos news on his website</li>
</ul>

<p>An observation: it is fascinating how the two Ed Week articles are set up to infer that I am just making stuff up about the future of Bezos&#8217; philanthropy, according to one male investment analyst quoted in both. (This individual called me "unhinged" on Twitter.) His speculations, I guess, are The Real Things. This very gendered framework happens all the time. Watch for it.</p>
