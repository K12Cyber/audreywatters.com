<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>

<h3>Family</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>The next few weeks are going to involve a lot of back-to-back travel: Madison to Amsterdam to Toronto to Bangor. The last two are family- not work-related. I&#8217;m speaking at my Granny&#8217;s memorial in Toronto and then will spend a few days in Maine with my brother and family.</li>
