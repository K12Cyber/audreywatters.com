<p>I got my flu shot today. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s only the second time I&#8217;ve got one. I did last year because I was taking classes at Columbia, and as teachers know, students are pretty damn germ-y. I was worried that I&#8217;d pick something up at school and bring it home to Kin, who seems to get sick from every virus he comes in contact with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not out-and-about much now that I&#8217;m back in Hermosa Beach. Indeed, Kin is one of the only people I&#8217;m in regular contact with. But I decided to get the needle jab today nonetheless &#8211; partly as I&#8217;m doing a little bit of traveling this fall, but mostly because I feel compelled to do something for the good of the herd.</p>

<p>Herd immunity. In this wealthy little beach town, folks don&#8217;t seem to care much of the herd. Affluent communities in California have some of the lowest rates of immunization in the US. When I asked the pharmacist today if a lot of people had been getting their flu shots, she laughed in my face.</p>

<p>The main street here is dotted with stores that sell all sorts of pseudo-scientific &#8220;health&#8221; aids: you can get botox injected into various body parts, and you can get IV drips to help you overcome a hangover; you can even get a variety of vitamin booster shots. Clearly it&#8217;s not the needle that&#8217;s scary. But god forbid you vaccinate yourself or your children against measles, whooping cough, or the flu.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is all deeply caught up with misinformation and disinformation campaigns that have part of the population fearful about the supposed dangers of immunizations. But there&#8217;s something to be said here too, I think, for the ways in which too many people &#8211; too many people in my neighborhood &#8211; believe that whiteness and affluence will shield their families from disaster, believe that they can somehow protect the individuals near them without any consideration for the rest of society. </p>
