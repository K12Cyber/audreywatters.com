He was the relative I most admired, the one who'd escaped Casper after high school, moved to New York City, got a job working for <em>LIFE </em>and later <em>People</em>, and only returned to our little shit-hole town for Christmas, and for barely 72 hours at that. When he'd visit, he'd have amazing stories from his interactions with movie and music stars: coming to blows with Arnold Schwarzenegger, getting the clasp on his watch caught in Tina Turner's wig, seeing Michael Jackson at a museum "disguised" wearing one of those Groucho Marx nose/eyebrow/mustache glasses. He knew their secrets (Donald Sutherland takes off his clothes at parties); he won their friendship (he has this really hideously gaudy ring given to him by Liza Minnelli). He wrote a book on the starlets from "classical" Hollywood -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Return-Engagement-Faces-Remember-Then/dp/B0026RX8KO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1267935575&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"><em>Return Engagement</em></a> -- and we'd watch old black-and-white films together while he'd dish out the dirt on who'd slept with who, who'd "named names," who was a drunk, who was a bore.<p></p>
Nevertheless, I probably won't watch the Oscars tomorrow night. I don't own a TV, so there you go. I've considered going down to the local arts cinema; they have a party and screen the awards show. But I have a lot to accomplish this weekend, and I'm not sure I can justify giving an evening over to smack-talking those on the Red Carpet. But without a doubt, I'll be keeping an eye on Twitter (you're gonna backchannel the show, right <a href="http://twitter.com/ebertchicago" target="_blank">Roger</a>?) to see who's won and to hear the gossip.<p></p>
Twitter gives all of us an "Uncle Jim" of sorts, as the tweets of celebrities frequently reveal things that the smoothly coordinated studio-arranged press conferences or the happenstance/horrible paparazzi won't/don't/can't. I'd never argue we see "the real" person via Twitter and the like; <strong>it's all performance.</strong> But Twitter and other social media add an interesting dimension to the "<a href="http://audreywatters.com/stargazing.pdf" target="_blank">star text</a>."<p></p>
