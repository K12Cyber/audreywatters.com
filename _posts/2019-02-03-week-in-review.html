<p>Although we&#8217;re still unsettled in Seattle &#8211; we sign a lease on an apartment on Tuesday &#8211; I did manage to get some writing done this week. Word count: 10,077. Total to date: 70,333. (I&#8217;ve set a goal to have 125,000 written by the end of February and to spend March polishing everything into an acceptable draft.)</p>

<p>I also (finally) finished going through all the photos and notes I took at ETS. (So now I can start working on the sections pertaining to Ben D. Wood, the Typewriter Experiment, and IBM&#8217;s test-scoring and teaching machines.)</p>

<br />
<p>I did most of my usual end-of-the-month activities: updating my CV and travel plans. I didn&#8217;t do some of the backups as the external hard drive I store those on is still in the old apartment. I also spent an inordinate amount of time setting up new accounts (Internet, insurance, electricity, etc) for the new place. </p>
