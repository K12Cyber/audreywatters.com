I'm not sure that tech journalists get more emails than any other professions do, but we seem to be a bunch of whiny bitches about it, and as folks who email us really do want something in return -- ya know, a story -- it makes sense, I guess, that we get to set some ground rules and offer some recommendations about what works and what doesn't work for getting our attention.<p></p>
<h2>I Hate Email</h2><p></p>
I receive hundreds of emails a day, although admittedly I filter the ones that go to tips@readwriteweb.com directly into a folder that I sometimes glance at but more often simply mark all as read.<p></p>
But even the messages addressed directly to me stack up.  I'm not always fast to read them, and if it's not a conversation (in other words, if it's just a pitch), I'm even slower to respond.<p></p>
Even though I tend to use my email inbox as a "to do" list, of sorts, sending me an email doesn't guarantee that you're "in."  There are far better ways to catch my attention -- to send me a tip, to pitch me a story, to connect and communicate with me -- <em>particularly if we have never spoken before</em>.  (Of course, if we <i>have talked</i> before and I've dropped the ball on a story, I'm sorry. You should pester me.  Just not, maybe, via email.)<p></p>
<h2>Alternatives to Email</h2><p></p>
Despite my loathing of email, I do spend my day tuned in to a multitude of other digital communications:  RSS and Twitter primarily.  And that's where I tend to get most of my story ideas.  <b>So blog and tweet -- that's your best bet for catching my attention.</b><p></p>
Follow me on Twitter.  Have an interesting bio -- particularly one that addresses my main interests and beats -- and I'll follow back.  @ me, and you'll find I often respond.<p></p>
CC me on a tweet, particularly one that links to a good blog post.  I'm always adding new blogs to my feeds.  Unlike my propensity to mark all read in email, I don't often do that in Google Reader.  I'm more likely to give a cursory read to at an update to your blog (or better yet, save it to read in full later) than I am to glance at an email.<p></p>
Use the contact forms here on this blog and on <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.  That shows me you've taken the 30 seconds or so that it takes to do a little bit more research about who I am (hopefully) than simply blasting out mass emails to every technology journalist in your Rolodex.<p></p>
<h2>Know My Beat</h2><p></p>
I care deeply about education.  If you are an ed-tech company, particularly a startup, I want to talk to you.<p></p>
My background is in academia: politics, literature and folklore.  So if you're working with e-readers, digital and cultural literacy, storytelling and/or social change, I'm interested in hearing about your projects.<p></p>
I'm a big supporter of open source.  I have a long history of activism and involvement in social justice movements.  And I want to support women in technology and women entrepreneurs.  Fall into one of those buckets, and hey, let's chat.<p></p>
That isn't to say that if you don't fall into one of those topics that I don't care. But please, pay attention to what I cover, (or what ReadWriteWeb covers), and don't pitch me on stories that demonstrate you have no idea who I am or what I do.  Don't think that because I'm a girl that I want to write about fashion.  Check how many times I've written about dating apps or funny kitty videos.  No really, go on.  Check.<p></p>
