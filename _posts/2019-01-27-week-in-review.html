<p>Big changes are coming. Big changes are here. Readers of API Evangelist might have noticed that <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2019/01/22/stepping-back-from-api-evangelist/">Kin announced</a> he&#8217;s stepping back from that role. He&#8217;s taken a full-time job, which started this week. That means we are moving to Seattle (we are up here now, obviously). This week I found us an apartment, although we won&#8217;t move in until Kin&#8217;s first paycheck clears the bank. Then we&#8217;ll head back down to Hermosa Beach in another week or so to actually move our stuff. Not the best thing to have happen while one is trying to write a book; but it&#8217;s hardly the worst.</p>

<p>This was the least productive week I&#8217;ve had so far since the beginning of the year in terms of the number of words written. Words this week: 8025. Total so far: 60,256. In addition to the move unsettling my writing rhythm, I&#8217;ve decided to alter it further by actually taking weekends off. I might write a little, but I am easing off on the phrenetic pace &#8211; right now &#8211; and the expectation that I spend every day churning out sentences.</p>
