<p>Another week where I&#8217;m going to skip giving an update on my word count. I did get some words written, but this week has mostly been about moving and packing. Next week doesn&#8217;t look to be much more productive either, as I&#8217;m traveling and speaking and then unpacking and assembly IKEA furniture. But then, we&#8217;ll be pretty much settled in Seattle, with my work space set up again. So onward&#8230;</p>

<p>While I haven&#8217;t been working too much on the book, I have used my free time to finalize a talk I&#8217;m giving at Austin Peay State University on Wednesday &#8211; and hopefully that talk is provide a basis for the introduction to <em>Teaching Machines</em>.</p>
