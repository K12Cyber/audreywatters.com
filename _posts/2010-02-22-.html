I was disappointed by <em>Shutter Island</em>.<p></p>
Let's call it "The Siskel Effect" -- the movie-going phenomenon whereby  you totally know the "surprise twist" to a film because you read the  reviews before shelling out your $8 for the evening's entertainment.  But even if you avoid <em>The New York Times</em> on release day, it still takes a  lot to shock and surprise you.<p></p>
Or, rather, it takes a lot to  shock and surprise <em>me</em>.<p></p>
And maybe I'm just making this up  for the purpose of this movie review, but I'd wager the last time I saw a  movie that made me utter "No fucking way" was <em>The Departed</em>.  Actually, I think I uttered it at least twice. "No. Fucking. Way." I  didn't see it coming. I was shocked, surprised... and thrilled.<p></p>
I  love Martin Scorsese, really I do. <em>Goodfellas </em>is my favorite  film, and the gangster movie my favorite genre. OK, Marty (yes, I can  call him Marty) isn't my favorite director. That'd be Quentin, followed  closely by Terry -- that's the power of the narrative and the power of  the imagination right there, lit geek that I am. But when it comes to  the power of the character and the actor, Scorsese reigns.<p></p>

Indeed, DiCaprio is great (he's certainly mastered the  Boston accent and the ability to cry). And if Scorsese has moved from  the character-centric genre of the gangster film to the mise-en-scene  focused, fear-invoking genre of the thriller, he does it well, if not a  bit heavy-handedly (CUE BAD WEATHER. CUE DOOM INVOKING MUSIC. CUE MAHLER!!!). But the  story -- Teddy's story -- while echoing the confusion, the  unreliability, and the madness of the mental institution on Shutter  Island, well, it just didn't shock or thrill me. And instead of leaving me saying  "No fucking way" left me muttering "you fucking kidding me?"<p></p>
And not  in a gangster sorta way.
