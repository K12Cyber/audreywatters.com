<p>I love my iPhone.  I won't lie.  It doesn't leave my side.</p>
<p>I try to reign in my love of the device.  I really do.  I mean, I am suspicious of Apple's control over mobile app development and distribution.  I don't like DRM.  But dammit, it's a beautiful piece of hardware; it's a <em>good</em> piece of hardware.  And as much as I'd like to switch to Android, I wonder if maybe I'll just stick with an iPhone.</p>
<p>Damn you, Steve Jobs, and your <a href="http://audreywatters.posterous.com/til-steve-jobs-got-on-stage-this-morning-i-wa">magical</a> keynote speeches.  Damn you.</p>
<p>I've got one more year on my contract with AT&amp;T.  But my phone is a 3G (yay early adopter blah blah blah), so I could upgrade.  Or... blah.  I dunno.</p>
<p>And so yeah, the spell cast by WWDC aside, I'm also in the market for a new laptop.  And again, based on hardware and design, I'm leaning toward Apple.</p>
<p>As I have a pretty mobile life, battery life is crucial.  I have to have a device that can run a full day without requiring a constant power supply - a complaint I hear about the Android.  And a complaint I definitely have about my Sony Vaio.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I've used a Mac, even longer since I owned one.  Like a lot of folks my age, I have really fond memories of Apple from when I was a kid, learning about computers.</p>
<p>But I am no Apple fanboi.  (Although sorry, but who cares if I am?!)  Rather I am, um, passionately ambivalent.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to rely solely on Apple technology -- although admittedly my PC can make no realistic claim for reliability.</p>
<p>Even so, I've learned to troubleshoot a PC pretty well (hitting helps, I find), and I'm nervous relearning a new OS when I am <em>so fucking busy</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I'm pretty open for advice, for what it's worth:  smartphone and laptop suggestions.</strong></p>
