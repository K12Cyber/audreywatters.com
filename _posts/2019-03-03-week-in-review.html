<p>I&#8217;m back at work on the book draft, which is due less than a month from now. I&#8217;m not confident I&#8217;ll make the deadline, but I&#8217;m not sure I won&#8217;t either. I have a couple more chunks to write, but then a lot of editing and polishing to do before it&#8217;s an acceptable draft. But I&#8217;m writing again&#8230; that&#8217;s the main thing.</p>

<br />
<p>I talked to Cecilia Frankel about speaking at an event in Sweden this summer, and I sent abstracts/titles to two conferences I&#8217;m speaking at later this year. My speaking schedule is getting full again, which feels nice.</p>

<p>I did all the usual end-of-the-month tasks this week &#8211; GitHub backups and CV updates and the like.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<li>We finally watched <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> this week, and it is, by far, the best comic book movie I&#8217;ve ever seen.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<p>Our friend Tony was in town this week, so we all had dinner at Sushi Kashiba which was $$$$ but worth it. (Except for the miso-marinated black cod, which I can pretty much replicate at home.)</p>
