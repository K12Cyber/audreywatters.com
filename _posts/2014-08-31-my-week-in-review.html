<h2>Travel and Speaking</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this from my aunt Carol&rsquo;s kitchen in Midhurt, Sussex. Yup, the Fall travel and speaking schedule has kicked off. We spent most of the week in Hermosa Beach before catching a red-eye to Toronto then to London Friday night. We got in late last night and will be here for the next 10 or so days.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next week</span>: Coventry, Newcastle, York, and London</p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I spent the week working on (almost-but-not-quite finalizing) my talks for ALT-C and University of Newcastle. I crossed some other little tasks off the To Do list, things I wanted to be sure I accomplished before leaving the country.</p>
<h2>Reading and Viewing</h2>
<p>I finished Lois Lowry&rsquo;s <em>Son</em>, rounding out <em>The Giver</em> quartet. For the first time in decades, I watched the MTV Video Music Awards. Because Beyonc&eacute;. On the flight over I watched the new <em>Godzilla</em> movie and <em>X-Men Days of Future Past</em>.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Friday was the <a href="/2014/08/29/nine-years-later/">ninth anniversary</a> of Anthony&rsquo;s death. Not much to say about that</p>
<p>And although this trip to the UK is about "business," it's also a family trip as well. Mum is here (she picked us up from the airport last night and has agreed to drive us around). And we'll have Granny over here to Carol's for Sunday lunch today.</p>
