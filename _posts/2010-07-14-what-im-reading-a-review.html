Perhaps that sounds strange for someone who professes such a love for reading and writing, for someone who was working on a PhD in literature.  It was, in all likelihood, that PhD that distanced me from both reading and writing, making them both weighty, unpleasant, laborious, a chore.  <p></p>
I am happy now that I can tell people when they ask me what I do for a living that I'm a writer.  And I equally happy, I think, to be a reader of fiction once again.<p></p>
I finished <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest</i> last night.  I started Neil Gaiman's <i>Fragile Things</i> immediately afterwards.  I move eagerly, hungrily from book to book, without the exhaustion of assigned readings, comprehensive exams, canonical studies.<p></p>
<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo-large2.jpg"><img src="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo-large2.jpg" alt="" title="the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo-large2" width="200" height="298" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1329" /></a>The introduction plus three pages into Gaiman's stories, I noticed the economy of his words and caught myself studying his craft not as a scholar, but as a writer myself.  I had a flash of the convoluted sentences and paragraphs I'd compose for academia; I thought about the precision of word choice demanded by my dissertation committee; I thought about semi-colons.  I thought about blogging.<p></p>
I've got on my long list of potential blog topics "Review of <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i>."  Indeed, Stieg Larsson's trilogy has been the spark for this reignited passion for fiction.  It's no surprise perhaps -- a series of novels about investigative journalism, about a tattooed hacker, about trauma and promises to oneself and ferocity and revenge.<p></p>
But I'm not sure how much I have to say about the novels other than "I loved them."  Crime thrillers, despite my love o film noir and gangster movies, are not a genre I'm typically drawn to, I'm sure in part because of the mountains of dead women's bodies that fill the pages.<p></p>

All the female characters, I think experience it in some form:  deeply sadistic and misogynist violence.  It is, after all, the world we live in outside the imagination of a novelist as well.  So perhaps it's the protagonist Lisbeth Salander's passionately emotionless, fanatically disengaged commitment to justice that I like -- all that conflict between being powerless and being all-powerful and all-knowing, being stripped of one's voice and having access to the technology tools and skills to broadcast truth, to challenge authority, to kick ass.<p></p>
Or maybe, it's just that after all these years feeling exhausted -- by school, by books, by words, by life -- that I finally have the energy again for imagination.
