I recorded a podcast today at work, the first podcast that I'd done in quite some time and the first one I'd done for work. I like podcasting, and it's something I wish the volunteers I work with would do more frequently. Podcasting is really quite easy -- it can be done with minimal hardware and software -- and as it can be syndicated with RSS and available for subscription via iTunes -- the major delivery site for MP3s -- it's a good way to distribute your ideas.
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hardware</strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Headset:</strong> I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-ClearChat-Comfort-Headset-Black/dp/B000UXZQ42/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1266983614&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">Logitech USB headset</a> that retails for roughly $30. You can spend as little or as much as you want on a headset. If you plan on using it frequently, I recommend investigating not just sound by comfort.</span></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>(PC) Software</strong></span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="Audacity" src="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/images/Audacity-logo-r_50pct.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="50" />Audacity:</strong> Audacity is a free, open-source tool that can be used for both recording and editing. (<a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">http://audacity.sourceforge.net</a>) If you're planning on podcasting solo, this will be the only software you need.</span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Skype: </strong> If you plan on conducting interviews or having multiple contributors to a podcast, Skype is the way to go. (<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank">http://www.skype.com</a>) Skype is a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) tool that allows free calls to other Skype users (and paid calls to landlines and cellphones).</span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>MP3 Skype Recorder: </strong> Skype does not have an innate recording device, but MP3 Skype Recorder is a free tool that works seamlessly with Skype. (<a href="http://voipcallrecording.com/">http://voipcallrecording.com</a>) This add-on launches alongside Skype and records your calls as MP3s.</span></strong></span></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Storage/Syndication</strong></span></strong></span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">There are many services that will store and syndicate your podcast. Liberation Syndication (<a href="http://www.libsyn.com" target="_blank">http://www.libsyn.com</a>)is a low-cost syndication service. For $5 a month, you can store up to 50 MB per month (that's about 3 20 minute shows.) Podbean (<a href="http://podbean.com" target="_blank">http://podbean.com</a>) offers a free syndication and storage service, with limited bandwidth and storage.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>How To Podcast</strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">1) <strong>Write a script. </strong>This is the writing instructor in me, perhaps: "Write an outline." You needn't write down what you want to say word-for-word. Indeed, that'll make you sound like you're, well, reading. But it helps to have an idea of what, when and how you want to share your ideas. Even with good editing tools, it's much easier to snip out pauses than have to reorder chunks of your audio track.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">2) <strong>Test your mic. </strong>Make sure that your voice is actually being recorded. The meter and the audio track will usually indicate when the software is picking up sound. You needn't worry about the bells and whistles of the software as long as your voice can be heard audibly.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/selectiontool.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-218" style="margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="selectiontool" src="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/selectiontool.jpg" alt="" width="89" height="81" /></a>3) <strong>Don't be afraid to edit. </strong> Once you're comfortable with Audacity, you can experiment with a variety of sound effects. But if you're a beginning podcaster, all you really need to know is how to cut out excessive um's. In Audacity, use the Selection tool to highlight parts of the file you'd like to delete. (Make sure your audio is not paused, but fully stopped -- that's the yellow square.) Highlight and press delete. If you need to zoom in to make sure you're getting just the right portion of the track, use the +/- magnifying glass tool - conveniently located next to the undo tool.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="color: #000000; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none;"><a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/timeshift.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-219" style="margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="timeshift" src="http://www.audreywatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/timeshift.jpg" alt="" width="81" height="55" /></a>4) <strong>Add a musical introduction.</strong> Even if you have a smokin' hot voice like I do (hahahahaha), you will want to add some music so that your podcast isn't merely talking. To add another audio trackin Audacity, you can simply Import New Track (this option is located under Project on the top menu). Then use the Timeshift tool to adjust the timing of your multiple tracks. (i.e. if you're importing an intro, you might want to slide your own voice track to the right).. There are lots of resources online where you can find free music to use in a podcast (e.g. </span><a href="http://freemusicarchive.org" target="_blank">http://freemusicarchive.org</a>). Be sure to check the Creative Commons licenses for music you wish to include. <em>And always give the artist credit</em>!</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">5) <strong>Save your work.</strong> You can save your file as an Audacity Project; this is useful if you want to continue to work on a project or return to it at a later date. But in order to upload it to most RSS services, you'll want to export it as an MP3. (To do this with Audacity, you'll need to download an additional LAME encoder. See Audacity's Help Wiki for details on how to get this file: <a href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Lame_Installation" target="_blank">http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Lame_Installation</a>)</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong><p></p>
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">6) <strong>Store/Syndicate. </strong>Once you've found a host for your podcasts and you have your feed established, you can submit your podcast to iTunes, so that it is available for subscription there. For details on this process, visit <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#submitandfeeback" target="_blank">Apple's website</a>.</span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong>
