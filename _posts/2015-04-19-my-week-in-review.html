<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I paid my taxes.</li>
<li>I finished my review of Liz Losh&#8217;s book <em>The War on Learning</em> for <em>Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em>.</li>
<li>I sent off the final draft of my essay for Routledge&#8217;s <em>World of Learning</em>.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m working on the next in my series of &#8220;history of the future&#8221; stories &#8211; this one is on the &#8220;factory model of education&#8221; (as a rhetorical tool, as much as a model of schooling).</li>
<li>I made a few updates to <a href="http://sf.hackeducation.com">sf.hackeducation.com</a>.</li>
<li>I had an interview with the Shuttleworth Foundation.</li>
<li>I had to muck around with Bridgy to get it to work properly on <a href="http://aud.life">my Known site</a>.</li>
<li>I added the Open Graph protocol to the header of my sites, hoping that images will be pulled correctly when posts are shared to Facebook.</li>
<li>I started trying to &#8220;<a href="http://indiewebify.me/">indiwebify</a>&#8221; my sites. (I admit, I have no clue how to deal with the h-card and h-entry business.)</li>
<li>Status: 18 days sober.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>We watched the season premiere of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (and I tried not to be the annoying viewer who kept pointing out that there were lots of changes from the book).</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve been binge-watching <em>The Newsroom</em>. (I have never watched much Aaron Sorkin.)</li>
<li>I finished <em>Tik-Tok of Oz</em>, and I started <em>The Scarecrow of Oz</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>The kid was here through Wednesday. He assembled a new Ikea bookshelf for me &#8211; without tears or curse-words.</li>
</ul>
