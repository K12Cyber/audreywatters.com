Folktales needn't contain all 31, but they are always comprised of some, according to Propp: an absent family member (a dead mother), an interdiction (if you touch the spinning wheel, you will die), a quest (deliver this food to Grandma's house), a magical object (pumpkin carriage), a marriage (happily ever after). (Check out this <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Courses/FR0133/Fairytale_Generator/gen.html">Proppian Fairy Tale generator</a> for more info.) <p></p>
Scholars have subsequently challenged Propp's Formalist approach, saying that it overlooks many important elements of storytelling. But as I spend my days reading stories about tech and tech businesses, the folklorist in me can't help but wonder how many of Propp's functions appear in the company creation or <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/7_stories_about_women_heroes_in_tech_-_please_send.php">brave founder hero</a> stories we tell.</i><p></p>
