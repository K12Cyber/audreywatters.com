<h3>Travel (and Speaking)</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Kin and I traveled to San Francisco and to Toronto this week, then back home to Hermosa Beach. Holy crap, Toronto was cold. That's where I spoke at <a href="http://changschooltalks.ryerson.ca/2015/">ChangSchoolTalks 2015</a>. (The transcript from my talk is below.)</li>
<li>Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I am now officially really really behind on the writing for <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>. (That&#8217;s how I&#8217;m going to be spending every moment between now and February 28, I think.)</li>
<li>I moved my slides from Slideshare to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/audreywatters">SpeakerDeck</a>. I get a lot of views on them at the former, but I&#8217;m just not happy using a LinkedIn-owned product, particularly after <a href="http://www.lucygray.org/weblog/2014/04/shame-on-slideshare-and-lessons-learned.html">what happened to Lucy Gray last year</a>.</li>
<li>I was cited in a <a href="http://www.harvardmagazine.com/2015/03/computing-in-the-classroom">Harvard Magazine</a> article about computers in the classroom.</li>
<li>I worked on the Federated Wiki for the &#8220;Teaching Machines Happening&#8221; that starts next month</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I read Kevin Carey&#8217;s forthcoming book <em>The End of College</em>.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m still reading Rebecca Solnit&#8217;s <em>River of Shadows</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I caught up with lots of friends this week, thanks to travel: Obie, Philipp, Melonie, George, Stephen, Giulia, Aron, Leila.</li>
<li>I talked to the kid this weekend. School sucks, apparently.</li>
</ul>
