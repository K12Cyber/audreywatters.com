<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/the-year-in-review-keynotes">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>In previous years, I've written a review of my years "in numbers," counting the number of keynotes, the number of cities I visited, the number of bands I've seen, etc. I need to write my year in words and tears instead this year. Nonetheless I'll make note of some of those numbers here.</p>
