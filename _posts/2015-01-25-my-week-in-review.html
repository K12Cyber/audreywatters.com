<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Nope. I was supposed to travel to Philadelphia on Thursday, but I got sick. I never get sick, but when I do, it&#8217;s often pretty bad. Needless to say, I spent part of yesterday in UrgentCare. I&#8217;m medicated now, and I hope, on the mend.</li>
<li>Upcoming week: Hermosa Beach.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I added an option to subscribe to Hack Education&#8217;s RSS feed via email (a functionality I lost when I moved off of Feedburner). (Sign up <a href="http://eepurl.com/bbOoYP">here</a>.)</li>
<li>I hit last week&#8217;s writing goal for <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em>, but I&#8217;m behind once again having been sick.</li>
<li>I worked on the essay I&#8217;m co-writing with Tressie McMillan Cottom on MOOCs and their vision of a post-racial meritocracy.</li>
<li>I had a great conversation with the folks at LEGO Education about the history of Mindstorms.</li>
<li>My final domain has been wrested from the grip of Go Daddy. Hover offers a &#8220;valet service,&#8221; so they took care of this for free &#8211; so great since it was an .es domain and transferring it was a bit complicated.</li>
<li>I recorded a brief rant for a video conversation that Jonathan Worth is orchestrating on trust, privacy, and open education.</li>
<li>I accepted speaking gigs in Barcelona in June and in Amsterdam in August.</li>
<li>I discovered I have been blocked on Twitter by Marc Andreessen. LOL.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I finished L. Frank Baum&#8217;s <em>Ozma of Oz</em> and started the next book in his Oz series, <em>Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz</em>.</li>
<li>I started Anya Kamenetz&#8217;s <em>The Test</em>.</li>
<li>I read Trevor Owens&#8217; <em>Designing Online Communities</em>, which I&#8217;ve promised to blurb.</li>
<li>Kin and I started watching <em>The Americans</em>. We&#8217;re still on Season 1.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Kin arrived home from Eugene &#8211; just in time for me to leave town, errrr, get sick.</li>
<li>The kid is still making his way through school. He says he&#8217;s planning to fill out a FAFSA so it looks like post-secondary education hasn&#8217;t scared him off yet.</li>
</ul>
