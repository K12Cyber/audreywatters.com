<p><em>I was asked to give a "provocation" to the Open Pedagogy and Social Justice track at this year's Digital Pedagogy Lab in Vancouver, BC. Here's (roughly) what I said:</em></p>
<p>When Rajiv and Robin sent me an email, asking me to pop into the class and say a few words to you, I immediately said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; in part because I think the theme of this track is so important. &ldquo;Open Pedagogy and Social Justice.&rdquo; I think it&rsquo;s important &ndash; crucial even &ndash; that the theme is explicit about its politics, that it centers &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; as part of its project. In fact, to me, that&rsquo;s the important part: &ldquo;social justice.&rdquo; Not the &ldquo;open&rdquo; bit.</p>
<p>Too often, I think, open education has come to rely on that adjective &ldquo;open&rdquo; to stand in for an <em>assumption</em> about politics, an assumption about good intentions and social change. Open education has acted as though &ldquo;open&rdquo; &ndash; as a label, as a license &ndash; is sufficient, as though the social change fostered by &ldquo;open&rdquo; will 1) happen and 2) be progressive.</p>
<p>If we look at history &ndash; hell, if we look around us today &ndash; we can find plenty of examples (in education and elsewhere) where &ldquo;open&rdquo; is not aligned with social justice. MIT researcher Justin Reich, for example, has found that open educational resources &ndash; MOOCs, Khan Academy, and so on &ndash; can actually expand education inequalities by disproportionately benefitting the affluent. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; is not enough &ndash; you have to be explicit, as this strand does, and orient your work towards social justice. &ldquo;Open&rdquo; does not necessarily address structural inequality at all.</p>
<p>Indeed, &ldquo;open&rdquo; <em>without</em> this orientation towards justice might make things worse.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that many of the conversations you&rsquo;ve had and will have in this track involve definitions &ndash; the often competing definitions &ndash; of &ldquo;open.&rdquo; Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean openly licensed content or code? And, again, which license is really &ldquo;open&rdquo;? (People love to argue about this one.) Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean &ldquo;made public&rdquo;? Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean shared? Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean &ldquo;accessible&rdquo;? Accessible how? To whom? Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean editable? Negotiable? Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean &ldquo;free&rdquo;? Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean &ldquo;open-ended&rdquo;? Does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean transparent? Does it mean &ldquo;open for business&rdquo;? Who gets to decide? That is, whose stories about &ldquo;open&rdquo; get told?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with my work, you know I spend a lot of time looking at the financial and political networks of education technology. And so this question of open education being so deeply intertwined with business &ndash; with venture capital and venture philanthropy &ndash; is something I&rsquo;m quite concerned about. And I think that&rsquo;s probably one of the greatest challenges that open education faces: can it extricate itself from the forces of education reform that are strikingly neoliberal, imperialist, and exploitative? As public education is under threat &ndash; from budget cuts, Betsy DeVos, and tech billionaires alike &ndash; will open education resist the dismantling of institutions, or will the movement (I guess it&rsquo;s a movement) ally itself with libertarians who seek to place all risk and responsibility onto the individual, place all teaching and learning under the rule of &ldquo;markets&rdquo;?</p>
<p>And will education &ndash; public education, open education &ndash; address its own history of white supremacy, exclusion, exploitation?</p>
<p>If I had one big concern personally (which is always politically) &ndash; and I realize my time is almost up here &ndash; it would be that I see &ldquo;open&rdquo; being weaponized by those who are, in my estimation, the very antithesis of social justice. This is the Julian Assange model of &ldquo;open,&rdquo; if you will. Weaponized transparency.</p>
<p>What does &ldquo;open&rdquo; mean in a world of Wikileaks? I think, in part, it means we need social justice. Indeed, we need to put social justice at the center of our work. And it means, dare I say, we distance ourselves from those for whom &ldquo;open&rdquo; is weaponized (or readily weaponizable) against marginalized people.</p>
