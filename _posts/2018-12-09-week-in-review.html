<ul>
<li>I am very excited with the prospect of having a research assistant, thanks to the help of Amy Collier, who&#8217;s put me in touch with Middlebury graduate student Noraya Razzaque, who&#8217;ll help me get stuff out of the ol&#8217; brick-and-mortar research library</li>
<li>Thanks to leaving social media, I was wildly productive this week &#8211; embarrassingly so. (I have wasted so much time!!) I made a huge breakthrough in my research this week, uncovering a connection between political movements and teaching machines that I didn&#8217;t know existed. This gives me a new character for the book too. I read a ton this week &#8211; articles and books &#8211; looking primarily at cybernetics, &#8220;the cult of information&#8221; (Roszak), and the Sixties (Roszak again) and wondering why it is that ed-tech is so intellectually vacuous considering its rich intellectual history. (I&#8217;m pretty sure I know the answer&#8230;)</li>
