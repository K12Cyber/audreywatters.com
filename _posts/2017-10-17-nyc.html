<p>I am not sure when it&rsquo;s really &ldquo;official.&rdquo; Am I a New Yorker when I rent an apartment? When I register to vote? When I get my New York driver&rsquo;s license? I&rsquo;ve done the first two at least.</p>
<p>This weekend, I returned to the apartment Kin and I called home for over three years to start the process of packing everything up. Much is going into storage &ndash; all of Anthony&rsquo;s artwork, primarily, which we&rsquo;d just pulled out of storage in Oregon a year ago. We&rsquo;ve lived on the road for so long; it&rsquo;s really only been within the last year or so that we started to accumulate possessions again: mostly books and artwork. That&rsquo;s all getting shipped east. The furniture &ndash; all that low-quality IKEA crap &ndash; is going up on Craigslist, free to the person who&rsquo;ll haul it away.</p>
<p>Hermosa Beach was really good to us. But it&rsquo;s time to move on.</p>
