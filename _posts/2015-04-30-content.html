<p>Content: it&rsquo;s what fills a container, whether that be a book, a film, a student&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Content: it&rsquo;s what is contained. Word origins:</p>

<p>Content: it&rsquo;s what is delivered &ndash; by a book, an instructor, a video, a piece of software. Use over time:</p>

<p>Content marketing. Content farms. Content creators. Content Providers. Content strategy. Content delivery. <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2014/08/content-distributed">Content distribution</a>. The content industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a little confused by the word &ldquo;content.&rdquo; There is something lonely and unconnected about the word somehow, when I hear it used with reference to what happens in learning. I imagine a lone student, huddled away in a dorm room, reading sanitized facts in the hopes of passing a multiple choice quiz. The content somehow merging with the learning objective and the assessment to create a world where learning is about acquiring truth from the truth box.</p>

<p>When did we start to think that the important thing in education was &ldquo;content&rdquo;? I don&rsquo;t mean simply memorization or recitation &ndash; yes, that has a long history. I mean, when did we start to use that word &ldquo;content&rdquo;?</p>
<p>How is &ldquo;content&rdquo; different than &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;? How is &ldquo;content&rdquo; different than &ldquo;subject&rdquo; or &ldquo;topic&rdquo; or &ldquo;curriculum&rdquo;?</p>
<p>How has technology &ndash; the digital content industry &ndash; shaped what we think learning looks like? Is there something about "content" that's easier to standardize, monetize?</p>
