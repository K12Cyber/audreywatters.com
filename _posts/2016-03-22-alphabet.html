<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2016/itunes-broke-the-alphabet">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s iTunes update has re-ordered my album collection when I sort alphabetically by artist (the way I typically display my music using that piece of software). And it&rsquo;s dumb.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been annoyed that it decided a-ha was first. Like, why does &ldquo;a-&rdquo; come before, say &ldquo;a.&rdquo; or &ldquo;a[space]&rdquo;? I've spent a lot of time thinking about how I could better display my music. Sort by genre. Sort by song title. But I like to group artists together.</p>
<p>Starting with a-ha was bad. But now, after today's iTunes update, it&rsquo;s worse.</p>
<p>A Tribe Called Quest is now the first artist when sorting alphabetically by artist. But only <em>two</em> of their songs. The rest of <em>People&rsquo;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</em>, and the other album I own by them, are down with the letter T.</p>
<p>Yes, I have long hated that I have been confronted with &ldquo;Take on Me&rdquo; as the first song every time I open iTunes. (I owned the record <em>Hunting High and Low</em>, but only ever bothered to buy one song digitally.) What a terrible reminder of one of the best years in music. (That's 1984. Duh.)</p>
<p>Years and years of a-ha first. Years and years of hearing the opening bars of "Take on Me" if I accidentally hit "play." But now, seeing these two songs from A Tribe Called Quest first, and knowing that there are 40 more down with the Ts and that iTunes cannot get alphabetization right, is going to piss me off even more.</p>

<p><em>Update: The day after I wrote this, I learned that Phife Dawg had passed away. RIP. A Tribe Called Quest stays first.</em></p>
