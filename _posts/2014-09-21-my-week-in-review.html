<h2>Travel</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/virtue.png" alt="" align="right" />I took a quick trip up to Eugene, Oregon to see the kid (and to see my optometrist), but I was back in Hermosa in time to suffer through this week&rsquo;s heat wave. Kin&rsquo;s finally back home from his whirlwind travels too.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Upcoming week</span>: Hermosa Beach and Chicago</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I read a bunch this week: Dana Goldstein&rsquo;s <em>The Teacher Wars</em>, Bruno Latour&rsquo;s <em>We Have Never Been Modern</em>, Jay Williams and Raymond Abrashkin&rsquo;s<em> Danny Dunn and the Homework Machine</em>, and John Scalzi&rsquo;s <em>Redshirts</em>.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I had a <a href="http://webliteracy.tumblr.com/post/97885076184/audrey-watters-is-a-writer-based-out-of-a">great chat</a> with Doug Belshaw about v2.0 of Mozilla&rsquo;s Web Literacy Map.</p>
<p>I also spoke with a publisher about <em>Teaching Machines</em>.</p>
<p>I was subtweeted by many men writing about LMSes and openness, was actually <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/09/19/ego_money_and_false_promises_michelle_rhees_big_secret_and_the_collapse_of_education_reform">cited in a Salon story</a> on the business of education reform, and got <a href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2014/09/my_feminism_starts_300_years_ago.html">a shout-out from my friend Tressie McMillan Cottom in Colorlines&rsquo; profile of her</a>. The latter made my week.</p>
<h2>Friends and Family</h2>
<p>What also made my week: seeing my kid in Eugene. He&rsquo;s doing pretty well and is making plans to go to college next term to pursue phlebotomy and Web design. (!!)</p>
<p>Bonus: while in Eugene, I got to hang out with friends Suzi Steffen and Adam Wendt.</p>
<p>Bummer: I must say I was a little sad to see the results of the Scottish independence referendum. It was good to see democracy in action, I suppose &ndash; almost 85% voter turnout &ndash; and I do have to believe that things will change as a result (even if the change isn&rsquo;t independence right now).</p>
