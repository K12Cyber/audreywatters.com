<p><strong>Google</strong>: I happened to notice on my iGoogle page tonight a friendly reminder to check on my<a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/">Google Dashboard</a> to "Review and control the data stored in your Google Account."</p>
<p>Google knows about my: Account, Alerts, Analytics, Blogger, Buzz, Calendar, Checkout, Contacts, Docs, Friend Connect, Gmail, Google Sync (to my iPad and my iPhone), iGoogle, Latitude, Picasa, Profile, Reader, Sites, Talk, Tasks, Voice, Web History, Webmaster Tools, and YouTube.</p>
<p>Sufficed to say, Google holds a shit-ton of my data. But that doesn't really alarm me -- not even after the snafu over the introduction of Buzz (OK, it does a little bit). I mostly trust Google, in no small part because they seem to be more transparent by making it easy to access my data and control my privacy settings for each of these programs (and easy for me to get my data out, via their<a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Data Liberation</a> initiative).</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong>:  I deactivated my Facebook account today.  After what I wrote <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=739">yesterday</a>, I don't know -- I was just done.</p>
<p>To my homies from Casper, the smart folks from grad school, select members of St. Clare's class of 1990 (you know who you are) -- <strong>please </strong><a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?page_id=2"><strong>stay in touch</strong></a>.  To the peeps in Eugene, pretty sure you have my number.  Whoever -- email me.  You can find me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/audreywatters">Twitter</a> and on Skype and on IM.  I'll still be blogging, I'll try to share cool links and videos somewhere (<a href="http://audreywatters.posterous.com">Posterous</a> probably), and maybe there'll even be photos on Flickr.  Hey, we can be all edgy and start a Google Wave, if you want.  Or we can go old school and chat while we play on Yahoo Games. Or we can (gasp) get together, face-to-face.  But Facebook?  I'm done.</p>
<p>I'm done because of all the privacy bullshit.  I'm done because seriously -- Facebook launches its location-based service with a partnership with McDonalds?!  To quote the Talking Heads, "This is not my beautiful house."  I'm done because I want an open web (of which an "<a href="http://www.openlike.org">open like</a>" is a part) --  not one dictated by Facebook's closed graph.  I'm done because Facebook is acting like Microsoft did ten or fifteen years ago, throwing its corporate weight around, ignoring open standards, forcing its shitty product down people's throats and trying to define the entire landscape of the technology industry.  Fuck that.</p>
<p>I guess this means I've got my eye out for a new social networking site. Google? (Now that you're extending your products to Apps for Business and Education...) Your move.</p>
