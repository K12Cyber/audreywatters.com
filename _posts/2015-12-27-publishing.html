<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/the-year-in-review-publishing-elsewhere">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>In previous years, I've written a review of my years "in numbers," counting the number of keynotes, the number of cities I visited, the number of bands I've seen, etc. I need to write my year in words and tears instead this year. Nonetheless I'll make note of some of those numbers here.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing beyond my own domain</strong>:</p>
<p>My work appeared in <em>Europa World of Learning</em>, <em>Boundary2</em>, World Innovation Summit for Education blog, <em>The Kernel</em>, <em>Bright</em>, <em>Hybrid Pedagogy</em>, <em>The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em>, <em>Inside Higher Ed</em>, and <em>Tech &amp; Learning.</em></p>
