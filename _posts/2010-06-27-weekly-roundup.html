<p>"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed," said Hemingway.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why I'm so exhausted. I wrote a lot this week (highlights: <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/06/delicious-founder-aol-exec-lau.php">Hacker Angels</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/06/posterous-and-ambition-a-lesso.php">Posterous/Ambition</a>, <a href="/admin/blog/=">New Domain for Google Secure Search</a>, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/06/former-aws-execs-launch-nimbula.php">Nimbula</a>). I finally wrote a review of the Humble Indie Bundle here (<a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1118">Lugaru</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1153">Gish</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1158">World of Goo</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1163">Penumbra Overture</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1171">Samorost 2</a>, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/?p=1130">Aquaria</a>).  And I've been doing a better job updating <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.</p>
<p>But here are some of the stories I didn't have the stamina/blood/time to write this week:</p>
<p><strong>The new iPhone</strong>:  Despite having a 3G and leaning heavily towards Apple fanboi-dom, I didn't pre-order a new iPhone.  And as the 24th was <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">Kin</a>'s birthday, I didn't really feel like I should spend the day in line to get one.  I did, however, try to upgrade my phone to the new iOS (and to a new jailbreak).  But it was a bad idea, so thank you Lifehacker, for writing the instructions on how to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5572003/how-to-downgrade-your-iphone-3g[s]-from-ios-4-to-ios-313">roll back</a> to an earlier operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Print versus Digital Media</strong>:  I got my Rolling Stone magazine in the mail late this week.  The issue contained a profile on <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236#1669501">General Stanley McChrystal</a> that by the time the magazine arrived "on newsstands" had already resulted in the General's firing -- and in Rolling Stone being "scooped" on their own story.  Techdirt has a pretty interesting <a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20100623/1827409941.shtml">analysis</a> of the whole print-first versus digital-first strategy in journalism.</p>
<p><strong>The Business of EdTech</strong>:  Ning <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/06/26/weekly-roundup-ed-tech-news-for-week-of-20-june-2010/">announced</a> this week that the educational publishing company Pearson has agreed to sponsor free Ning Minis for teachers.  I've been thinking a lot about the relationship between industry and education this week.  ISTE 2010 just kicked off, after all.  (I could say more about my preference for bleeding over a typewriter versus bleeding over conference planning -- but that's a story for another day too.)</p>
