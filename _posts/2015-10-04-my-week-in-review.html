<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I submitted a copy of my talk at ISTE, &#8220;Is It Time to Give Up on Computers,&#8221; to Gary Stager for a collection he&#8217;s publishing.</li>
<li>I made arrangements to fly to Seattle for NWLearn. (I still need to plan how I&#8217;m getting from Seattle to Olympia.)</li>
<li>Therapy! Al Anon!</li>
<li>It was time, once again, for my monthly backups, website updates, and invoicing.</li>
<li>I updated the spreadsheet on ed-tech funding. I wrote a blog post (see above) but I feel like my analysis was totally off, in part because of three major rounds of funding this week that really skewed what I could say about September&#8217;s investment (and more generally about trends in ed-tech investing). Oh well.</li>
<li>I worked on my ICDE keynote.</li>
</ul>
