<p>Today was commencement at Columbia University. I didn&#8217;t march (because I&#8217;m not graduating), but the Spencer Fellows did get a certificate so I agreed to show up to the J-School ceremony this afternoon. I&#8217;m not so into the pomp and circumstance, but I get it: rituals help us mark beginnings and endings, and certainly graduation ceremonies do just that. (And I&#8217;m glad I did because Ira Glass delivered a really great speech.)</p>

<p>I am more than a little sad that my Spencer year is over. It&#8217;s been pretty incredible to have the time and financial resources to think deeply about education technology without worrying about &#8220;the hustle&#8221; of being a self-employed writer. I have read a lot of books. I have done a lot of research. I&#8217;ve still managed to churn out a fair number of words on Hack Education. I&#8217;ve created over one hundred data sets tracking ed-tech investments and investors (and I&#8217;ve got an article forthcoming this fall in The Baffler on the networks that really drive ed-tech products and policies). And most significantly, I think, I have a very good book proposal and sample chapter.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s next? Finish <em>Teaching Machines</em>. Really.</p>

<p>I sent my materials off to an agent this week, so hopefully I&#8217;ll secure representation and then a book contract. I plan to keep working on the research and reporting for the book over the summer. I&#8217;ve scheduled a trip to the Harvard University archives to look at B. F. Skinner&#8217;s papers and one to the Stanford University archives to look at Patrick Suppes&#8217;. I&#8217;m still looking for Norman Crowder&#8217;s papers, if anyone has any leads. </p>

<p>I have started accepting speaking gigs once again, and &#8211; book contract not withstanding &#8211; I&#8217;ll go back to supporting myself primarily through that work (along with the donations I receive for my writing on Hack Education).</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m really hoping that I can use the line on my CV that reads &#8220;Spencer Fellow 2017&#8211;2018&#8221; to make the move to book-writing full time. (Editors and agents: hit me up!)</p>
