<h2 style="text-align: left;">Travel</h2>
<p>Most of the week was spent in Hermosa Beach. Kin and I flew to Stockholm (directly flight from LAX &ndash; that was nice) on Friday night. Upcoming week: Stockholm, then back to Hermosa Beach.</p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>Not much to report this week, as I&rsquo;ve been working on all the talks I have to give in November. I&rsquo;m not quite in panic mode yet, but close.</p>
<p>I answered a couple of questions for a project by two students at the Education Program at St. Thomas University. And I was the &ldquo;visiting expert&rdquo; in the Stanford/edX &ldquo;<a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Education/OpenKnowledge/Fall2014/info">Open Knowledges</a>&rdquo; class.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Worth noting that, at age 21, the kid finally got his learner&rsquo;s permit this week. I do wonder if all the pronouncements that &ldquo;kids don&rsquo;t want to drive; they want iPhones&rdquo; will change once they reach adulthood and realize that, sadly, a car is still necessary in many places in order to get to and from work.</p>
