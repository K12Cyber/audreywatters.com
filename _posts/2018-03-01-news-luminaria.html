<p>The New York Times&#8217; Adam Baidawi talked to me about a new private school startup in Australia, Luminaria. I had a lot more to say than what appears in print (not surprisingly). </p>

<p>From &#8220;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/world/australia/school-tech-lumineer-academy-susan-wu.html">Why This Tech Executive Says Her Plan to Disrupt Education Is Different</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;I was kind of impressed with the number of clich√©s and buzzwords that they packed into a short amount of marketing copy,&#8221; said Audrey Watters, whose blog, Hack Education, analyzes the intersection of education and tech. &#8220;In the case of Luminaria, they have everything, they have all the buzzwords: social and emotional learning, mind-sets, grit, S.T.E.M., mindfulness, authentic learning, global consciousness. I mean, pick two of those.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonus points that the NYT actually linked to Hack Education.</p>
