<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/end-of-the-year-projects">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>Now that I've finished my "Top Ed-Tech Trends of 2015" series, I want to turn to some other projects to wrap up the year. I still have to finish recording audio for <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> and <em>The Revenge of the Monsters of Education Technology</em>. I need to do some more work on the "<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/08/28/adopta/">Adopt-a</a>" efforts for which Kin has received a grant.</p>
<p>And I need to give all my sites a lick and a polish. I need to make sure that code for the Jekyll template I'm using is up-to-date. And I want to change the header image. That is, I want to change out one pigeon picture for another.</p>
<p>I've spent the afternoon looking at pigeon pictures on Flickr. (Side note: I want to throttle people who license their photos openly but place text with a copyright notice on the image.)</p>
<p>I can't really find one photo that I like more than the one I use now. So I think I'm going to use a different pigeon photo for each project (which is, in turn, its own GitHub repo).</p>
<p>Here are some of the images I really like:</p>
