<p><em>"Pasteboard pies and paper flowers are being banished from the stage by the growth of that power of accurate observation which is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it&hellip;" -- George Bernard Shaw</em></p>
<p>For what it's worth, <a href="http://doug-johnson.squarespace.com/blue-skunk-blog/2015/6/1/when-tech-is-a-cheap-substitute.html">I don't think I'm a cynic</a>. I do believe that the world is broken, but not hopelessly so. If I didn't think that there was a chance to make things better, I definitely wouldn't do what I do.</p>
