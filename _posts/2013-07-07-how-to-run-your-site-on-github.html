<p>Last week, I made a couple of updates to <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>I refreshed some of the content on the <a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com">Hack Education Ed-Tech Guide</a>.</li>
<li>I added a section with some details, including a partial bibliography and a chapter outline, about my forthcoming book <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these sections exist as &ndash; and the pages are run off of &ndash; <a href="http://github.com">GitHub repositories</a>.</p>
<h2>Why (I Hope) GitHub Works</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve opted to use GitHub, a site known best for hosting open source code, because I want to solicit feedback on both of my projects. I want the data &ndash; bibliographies mostly &ndash; to be openly accessible; I want comments; I&rsquo;d love to see the resources expanded and/or forked; I want to encourage contribution and feedback. GitHub isn&rsquo;t the perfect place for that, I do realize. (I ran into all sorts of problems, for example, when I put the <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/learnersrights/blob/master/bill_of_rights.md">Learners&rsquo; Bill of Rights</a> there.)</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also using GitHub because (thanks to <a href="http://kinlane.com">Kin</a>) I&rsquo;ve found it to be an incredibly simple way to create pages for my sites.</p>
<h2>How to Run Your Site Off of GitHub</h2>
<p><strong>1. Register your domain.</strong></p>
<p>I use <a href="http://hover.com">Hover</a> for this. (Never ever ever use GoDaddy. It is evil.) You can also use this step to set up a subdomain on a domain you already own.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create your repository at GitHub.</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/1create.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Make sure to initialize the repo with a README file. Then, once the repository has been created, go to Settings.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/2newrepo.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and click on the &ldquo;Automatic Page Generator&rdquo; button.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/3automaticpage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>A GitHub Page will be generated, full of sample Markdown text (that you can freely delete here).</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/4createpage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click on the &ldquo;Continue to Layouts&rdquo; button, where you&rsquo;ll be asked to choose a template. You can change the CSS on your site later, so just pick an interim &ldquo;look&rdquo; for your Page. Hit &ldquo;Publish.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/5template.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>3. Clone the repository to your desktop</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/6clone.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, download the native app for GitHub (<a href="http://mac.github.com/">Mac</a>, <a href="http://windows.github.com/">Windows</a>).</p>
<p>Once you link your account, you&rsquo;ll be able to clone your GitHub repository to your desktop. Choose the folder where you want this to live. (I use &ldquo;Documents.&rdquo;)</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/7clone.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Open the repo on your desktop and switch branches to gh-pages</strong></p>
<ol> </ol>
<p>Open the repository. Click on the &ldquo;Branches&rdquo; option on the left-hand menu. There you&rsquo;ll see 2 branches: the master and gh-pages. If you hover your mouse to the left of the gh-pages branch, a check mark will appear. Click on that to switch to gh-pages (It will now appear on top.)</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/8branch.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>This means that edits you make locally to the repo will appear on gh-pages rather than on the master branch. (This is useful if you want to keep the master branch for other content. This is what I&rsquo;m doing with my recent repos. It allows me to accept pull requests to the master without necessarily updating my site pages.)</p>
<p><strong>5. Open files in your editor</strong></p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a> for Web development. Navigate to the folder where you have your repo stored on your desktop. There you&rsquo;ll find several subfolders &ndash; fonts, images, javascripts, stylesheets &ndash; and two files &ndash; index.html and params.json. Open index.html.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/9folders.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>6. Edit index.html</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/10index.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When I added the Hack Education Ed-Tech Guide and the Teaching Machines GitHub repos to my site, I wanted to maintain the look of the rest of the blog. So I deleted all the contents of this auto-generated index.html file, then copied the style from the main Hack Education blog to index.html. (To do so, I went to a single blog entry and hit &ldquo;View Source.&rdquo; That allowed me to copy the header and the right-hand column of Hack Education. I then just had to edit part that contained the blog post content.)</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/11viewsource.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Save your work.</p>
<p><strong>7. Commit your changes</strong></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/12commit.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made the changes you want to index.html, you&rsquo;ll need to go back to the GitHub app. Add a commit summary, hit &ldquo;commit.&rdquo; Then hit &ldquo;sync.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/13sync.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry: sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes for changes to show up on your GitHub page.</p>
<p><strong>8. Add additional HTML pages, if desired</strong></p>
<p>You can use this same process to create additional HTML pages. For the Ed-Tech Guide, for example, I created techies.html and edu.html. I simply copied index.html to do so, then edited what I need to change.</p>
<p>Again, any changes you make locally will need to be synced with GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>9. Create a CNAME file</strong></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re happy with how the new HTML looks, you can go about redirecting the site from GitHub&rsquo;s hosting to your own domain.</p>
<p>To do so, go into the local folder and create a new file. Call it CNAME.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/14cname.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the file, enter the domain or subdomain you plan to use. No http:// and no quotations.</p>
<p>Commit your changes. Sync with GitHub.</p>
<p><strong>10. Edit DNS</strong></p>
<p>The URL for your GitHub Page will look something like&nbsp;http://audreywatters.github.io/NewRepo. But you'll want to redirect that to your URL-of-choice.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/audreywatters/15dns.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Go to your domain registry service. (Again, I use Hover.) Change the DNS of the domain (or subdomain) to <strong>204.232.175.78</strong>. (I like to use <a href="/admin/blog/centralops.net">Central Ops</a> to check to make sure I've set up the DNS correctly before I actually try to load the page.)</p>
<h2>GitHub Pages and Owning Your Own Domain</h2>
<p>I think that GitHub Pages could make a great tool for teachers and students who are reluctant to undertake something like a WordPress install, and this is part of the larger effort that I&rsquo;m committed to: folks <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/04/11/reclaim-your-domain/">owning their own domain</a>.</p>
<p>This process makes it fairly easy to create a personal landing page, if nothing else. (Although yes, it does require some basic HTML knowledge.) You could also use this process to duplicate "the look and feel" of a blog you already have and use GitHub to host static pages, such as a CV or syllabi, as a subdomain.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions. Like most walkthroughs, I'm sure I've neglected to write out all the steps clearly!</p>
