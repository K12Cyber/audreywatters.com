<p>What I&#8217;m working on:</p>

<h3>Hack Education</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ll continue to write my weekly round-up of education news. (These posts are essential when it comes time for me to write my year-end review of the <a href="http://research.hackeducation.com/trends.html">top ed-tech trends</a>.) I&#8217;ll also continue to write a <a href="http://tinyletter.com/audreywatters">weekly newsletter</a>, which is more of a list of &#8220;recommended readings.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also set a goal to write one long-form piece on Hack Education every week. (My first one of the year was on "<a href="http://hackeducation.com/2015/01/06/wearables/">wearables</a>.")</p>

<h3>Reclaim Your Domain</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;m working on a <a href="http://reclaim.hackeducation.com">book</a> currently called <em>Reclaim Your Domain: Building Learner-Centered Technologies</em>. The book paints an alternative picture to much of the ed-tech that we use today. Think of it as &#8220;<a href="http://2014trends.hackeducation.com/indie.html">The Indie Web</a>,&#8221; but for K&#8211;12 not just adult learners. The manuscript is due by the end of February. </p>

<h3>Teaching Machines</h3>
<br />
<p>Once I get the <em>Reclaim Your Domain</em> manuscript shipped off to the publisher, I&#8217;ll go back to this <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">ongoing book project</a>. I am determined to finish it this year. And as you can tell by my post, I&#8217;ve totally managed to clear my work schedule in order to do so. (I&#8217;m thinking of submitting a <a href="http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2014-12-01">proposal to the NEH</a> for the book. We&#8217;ll see.)</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;ve started the GitHub repo to track on the <a href="http://2015trends.hackeducation.com">2015 Top Ed-Tech Trends</a>. Related to the trends, I&#8217;m going to do a better job of <a href="http://matrix.hackeducation.com">tracking ed-tech investment</a> this year. I&#8217;ll be releasing the info monthly in a JSON format. Because seriously, screw PDFs. In related news, I&#8217;ve also started work on what I&#8217;m calling <a href="http://horizon.hackeducation.com">The Horizon Report Data Liberation Project</a>. </p>

<h3>Articles Elsewhere</h3>
<br />
<p>I&#8217;m working on an article with Tressie McMillan Cottom on race and MOOCs. And I&#8217;m working on an article on the history of MOOCs as well. Both of these are for academic publications. (I remain a "recovering academic.")

<h3>Educating Modern Learners</h3>
<br />
<p>Although I won't be editing the publication, I&#8217;ll still be contributing <a href="http://modernlearners.com">Educating Modern Learners</a>&#8217; &#8220;What You Should Know This Week&#8221; article every Friday. And I&#8217;ll probably write an article or two a month as well.</p>

<h3>Speaking</h3>
<br />
<p>Jos√© Vilson and I are facilitating a conversation at Educon again this year. I&#8217;m speaking at Ryerson University in February. I&#8217;m on the DML conference committee, and I&#8217;ll pull together a featured panel for that (featuring Tressie, Kate Bowles, and myself). It looks like I&#8217;m going to ISTE in Philadelphia this summer. I&#8217;ll accompany Kin to Sydney and Berlin. And I&#8217;m speaking at the ICDE World Conference in South Africa this fall. </p>

<p>I have really really tried to cut back my travel. I swear.</p>

<h3>Other...</h3>
<br />
<p>I have a couple of other potential projects in the works too. But the most important thing for me this year is to focus on <strong>writing</strong>.</p>
