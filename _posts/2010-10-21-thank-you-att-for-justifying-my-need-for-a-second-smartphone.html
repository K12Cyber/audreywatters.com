I fear I am "one of those people."  On my desk sits a MacBook Pro.  i've got my iPad propped up next to it, streaming Battlestar Galactica.  My iPhone 4 is charging.<p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201010me_geek.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201010me_geek.jpg" alt="" title="me_geek" width="275" height="260" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1627" /></a>And add to that now, my new Android phone.<p></p>
Well, it's new to me.  <a href="http://www.kinlane.com">Kin</a> got the phone at Google I/O last spring, and it's sat inactive, unused since then.<p></p>
But there's nothing like a trip to San Francisco to remind you that AT&T service is unacceptable if you rely, as I do, on your smartphone to actually work.<p></p>
I can justify the second phone -- and a separate platform -- as a work expense, I guess.  After all, it's good to be able to actually look at an Android app if I've got to write news about releases and updates.<p></p>
In addition to, ya know, actually having phone service, I am most excited to have access to the <a href="http://www.hackeducation.com/2010/07/12/app-inventor-for-android-lets-teach-kids-to-make-their-own-apps/">Android App Inventor</a>, and I hope to write up some thoughts on my first stab at app development.<p></p>
But until then, my first impressions:<p></p>
<ul class="mainlist"><li>The iPhone is a beautiful piece of equipment.  I prefer its look and feel and weight.  But admittedly, I have a Motorola Android with a slide-out keyboard that I'll never use, for which the Droid lose aesthetic points.</li><li>I was able to find the apps I wanted on the Android, and they work just as well, if not better than those on the iPhone</li><li>Now that I have Google Goggles on my iPhone, I'm not so blown away by the difference with the Google Apps on the iPhone and Android. Am I missing something?</li><li>I like the way notifications work on the Android.  (Also, I like how it says "DROID," something I'm sure I'll tire of soon.  But for now, it's awesome.)</li><li>The iPhone 4 has a great camera. Even better, it has <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/instagram_has_made_me_an_iphone_photo_addict.php">Instagram</a>.</li><li>The Android battery isn't as good as the iPhone's.  It's not about "Flash," as I haven't downloaded Flash on the Android yet (I mean, why would I?!)</li><li>I appreciate being able to see "under the hood" with the Android.</li></ul>
