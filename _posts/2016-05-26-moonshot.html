<p>This all feels very out of control. Out of <em>my</em> control. My therapist would interject here that, when it comes to a loved one&#8217;s addiction, indeed it is. </p>

<p>Addiction. It&#8217;s not really my story to tell (right now). I am not certain I can find the right words to begin to explain my piece of it. In time, perhaps, I will. I&#8217;ve wanted to write about this &#8211; all the ways addictions have shaped my life for a while now (my father's addiction, as well as my son's), but it&#8217;s all so complicated and so personal and so messy and so painful. And we&#8217;re in the middle of it. "We" my family. "We" society. It&#8217;s difficult to tell a story that&#8217;s still (and always) unfolding.</p>

<p>I will say this: I am deeply grateful for the love and support that friends have shown us over the course of this past week since Kin announced that <a href="http://kinlane.com/2016/05/23/more-investment-is-needed-requiring-some-big-changes">he was selling API Evangelist and heading &#8220;into the wild,&#8221; if you will, with my son</a>.</p>

<p>I am also tremendously cautious about their whole endeavor, and particularly now that there are so many eyes on us, I am more than a little unsettled about the pressure this attention places on myself, on Kin, and most importantly, on my son. Hope hurts. If you've lived with an addict, you probably know that.</p>

<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any heroin moonshots,&#8221; a friend recently cautioned me, and for now I&#8217;ll just remind everyone of that in turn.</p>
