<p>Dropbox deleted my Dropbox account. It&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve had for years now, even paying for additional storage space in order to have some 30 GB of files synced and available across all my devices.</p>

<p>I should note here: I didn&#8217;t use Dropbox as my only storage service. Much of my data is on Amazon Web Services; some is in iCloud; some is still in Google Drive. Dropbox was where I kept things that I didn&#8217;t necessarily need on my machine, but that I did still access fairly frequently: a headshot, the pigeon and typewriter logo, PDFs I should be reading, and stuff like that.</p>

<p>This summer, when we were in the middle of the Drone Recovery journal, Kin created a business account so that he could more easily upload and share Drone Recovery files with me. (Video and photo data demanded we purchase more storage.) I was added to the Drone Recovery &#8220;team&#8221; on Dropbox, so I had access to a folder in my Dropbox account where I could get to all those videos and photos and draft blog posts.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking to save some money, so this week, Kin opted to cancel that business account, so he removed me as a team member. When I woke up Wednesday, I&#8217;d been logged out of my Dropbox account &#8211; or so I thought. When I entered my credentials, Dropbox told me that there was no user with that email address.</p>

<p>My account was gone.</p>

<p>In removing me from the Drone Recovery team, Dropbox removed me from Dropbox entirely &#8211; even though only one shared folder in my Dropbox account was associated with that particular administrative privilege.</p>

<p>My data was gone &#8211; or so I thought. When Kin logged into Dropbox, he found my whole account &#8211; <em>all my personal data</em> &#8211; had been transferred to his. In this case, it&#8217;s not a huge issue. He&#8217;s my partner. But good grief, imagine all the ways in which this could go desperately wrong. If you're fired from work. If you have sensitive records you cannot share with anyone. <strong>This is a huge privacy and security flaw. Dropbox says the process is &#8220;working as intended.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;m not going to rejoin Dropbox once Kin gives me back that 30 GB of data. I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m going to do. All the alternatives suck.</p>
