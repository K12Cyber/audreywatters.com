<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Last Sunday, I made The New Inquiry &ldquo;<a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/features/sunday-reading-89/">Sunday Reading List</a>,&rdquo; for what I think is the first time.</li>
<li>My article &ldquo;The Problem with Personalization&rdquo; was published in the November issue of <em>Australian Educational Leader</em>. (I didn&rsquo;t realize it had hit the newsstand &rsquo;til I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/edusum/status/544354155192537088">a tweet from Summer Howarth</a>.</li>
<li>The panel that Gary Stager proposed &ndash; Is It Time to Get Rid of Computers in Schools? &ndash; was accepted to ISTE. LOL.</li>
<li>I had a quick chat with Zac Chase, who&rsquo;s now at the Department of Education, about ed-tech and equity.</li>
<li>I recorded my final thoughts for the <a href="http://edtechconcerns.com/">Ed-Tech Concerns</a> podcast series.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve made $330 in sales of <em>The Monsters of Education Technology</em> on Gumroad this month. I&rsquo;m debating whether or not I should post publicly what I&rsquo;ve made on lectures this year. I think folks believe I&rsquo;m raking in the cash. I didn&rsquo;t get paid for a lot of my lectures. I dunno&hellip;</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m taking part in Mike Caulfield&rsquo;s Federated Wiki &ldquo;<a href="http://tinyletter.com/m42/archive">Happening</a>&rdquo;. (My wiki is <a href="http://audrey.sf.fedwikihappening.net/">here</a>.) I&rsquo;m hoping to have a little bit more time to work on this now that I&rsquo;m done with my Top Ed-Tech Trends series.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m sketching out a major redesign of my sites. I plan to move everything to Jekyll. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Listening and Viewing</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought the new D&rsquo;Angelo album, <em>Black Messiah</em>.</li>
<li>I watched a few old Colbert Report shows, in the build up to its last night on the air. But I went to bed before the last episode. Because I&rsquo;m old.</li>
<li>And I caught up on the final two episodes in this season&rsquo;s <em>Serial</em>. I dunno... there was this unexamined white privilege that permeated the storytelling. I liked it less and less with each episode. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Family</h2>
<ul>
<li>The kid is here for a week. I think our only real plans are to eat a lot of food &ndash; and do a little bit of Web design. Nerds gonna nerd, I guess.</li>
</ul>
