<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201005zuck.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-849" style="margin: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="zuck" src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201005zuck.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></a>So Mark Zuckerberg held a press conference today.  He was contrite and forthcoming and apologetic.  <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_half_truths_of_mark_zuckerberg.php">Except not really</a>.<p></p>
He did introduce some changes to the Facebook privacy controls.  They're simpler.  You can hide the pages you've "liked."  And for that, I'm happy.<p></p>
I'm also happy that lots of us balked at Zuckerberg's cavalier attitude towards his users' data and privacy.  I'm glad that the tech industry has had to address this.  I've seen some really smart analyses, a sign, despite what some folks would claim, that the privacy issue is important (or important to smart folks, perhaps).<p></p>
So now what?  I mean, I've gone over two weeks without Facebook, and while I probably would've once argued that the site brought real value into my life, ya know, I haven't really missed it that much. And I don't really think my "friends" have missed me either.<p></p>
Will I rejoin Facebook?  I don't know.  Probably.  But meh.<p></p>
And not to downplay the mini-victory today with Facebook's altered privacy controls, I do hope the larger victory is that more of us shrug and say "meh" to Facebook and look for new and innovative networks elsewhere.
