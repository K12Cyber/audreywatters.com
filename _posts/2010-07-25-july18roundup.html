My greatest triumph this week was my post "<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2010/07/cassandra-predicting-the-futur.php">Cassandra:  Predicting the Future of NoSQL</a>."  It took me a long time to write, in part because it took me a long time to grok WTF is NoSQL.  And so I'm pretty proud I was able to pull together a blog post that (I think) was technically accurate.  But it was also a literary thing of beauty (in my mind, ok?) as I invoked Greek mythology <i>and</i> I got away with a header saying "MySQL RDBS BBQ" (although the latter suggests that very few people actually read the post as no one said "WTF BBQ" in response.)<p></p>
Ah well.  <p></p>
As for the stories I didn't tell this week, there are a number of them.  I was on the road (at <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/07/25/1/">OSCON</a>) and I met a lot of really smart folks.  I heard several utterances of "...but don't write that."  So that's my excuse for not having done so.<p></p>
<a href="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201007schorrdanie.jpg"><img src="http://hackedu.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-contentuploads201007schorrdanie.jpg" alt="" title="schorrdanie" width="226" height="300" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1386" /></a>But I would be remiss if I didn't mention the passing of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/business/media/24schorr.html">Daniel Schorr</a> this week.  I've long admired him for being part of the journalistic tradition that challenges those in power.  "He found a great way of irritating government officials," said colleague Bob Schieffer, "because he always came up with the truth."<p></p>
I don't believe speaking truth to power is solely the purview of journalists, just as fighting evil doesn't necessitate a <a href="http://growingupheroes.com/">superhero costume</a> (which is, in retrospect, sort of a shame).<p></p>
But Schorr taught me that even though you find your name on the enemies list, you keep reading, keep writing, keep talking, knowing that you're probably doing something right.
