<p>2018 has been an incredible year of upheaval for me, with some pretty major personal and professional changes. I finished up my Spencer Fellowship, taking Sam Freedman&#8217;s legendary book-writing class this spring. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2018/06/28/mit-university-press">I signed a book deal</a>. We moved. Again. Once back in Hermosa Beach, I started exercising a lot more regular &#8211; walking <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2018/11/14/fitbit">at least</a> 5 miles a day. <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2018/08/14/cooking">I started cooking again</a> &#8211; something I hadn&#8217;t really been into for the past decade, so thoroughly worn out I was &#8211; spiritually, emotionally &#8211; from care-taking a dying husband back in 2015. As the year drew to a close, I decided it was best to sunset a lot of the work I&#8217;ve been doing for the past not-quite-decade on Hack Education&#8230; at least temporarily while the book gets written. To that end, <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2018/11/26/break">I quit social media</a> too. And oh yeah. Last week, Kin and I [redacted], something we joked we would never do and something that portends even more changes in the coming year.</p>

<p>Focused on the fellowship and the book, I didn&#8217;t do a lot of other speaking or writing in 2018. I did pen a foreword to Sean Michael Morris and Jesse Stommel&#8217;s collection of essays. I had chapters in two other books, and I blurbed John Warner&#8217;s. I published my first article on <em>Vice</em>, a writing success that more than any other my son thought was &#8220;cool.&#8221; I gave a couple of talks and a couple of guest lectures and sat on a panel and was in absentia from another.</p>

<p>I was &#8220;in the news&#8221; and on podcasts talking about (among other things) the &#8220;tech regrets&#8221; industry, personalized learning, new startups, old education ideas, billionaire philanthropists, and Ursula K. Le Guin. (RIP.)</p>

<p>I promised myself I&#8217;d sit still and focus but I still traveled a lot, with overnight stays in Philadelphia, PA; Columbus, OH; San Diego, CA; Cambridge, MA; Albuquerque, NM; Palo Alto, CA; Millbrae, CA; Paris, France; Grenoble, France; Annecy, France; Chamonix, France; Parsippany, NJ; Elyria, OH; Ottawa, IL; Omaha, NE; Fort Morgan, CO; Salina, UT; Barstow, CA; Inverness, Scotland; Edinburgh, Scotland; Indianapolis, IN; Rome, Italy; Princeton, NJ; and Las Vegas, NV.</p>

<p>I took some nice photos throughout the year, but they&#8217;re on Instagram, and I&#8217;m not logging in just to locate and share them here. The year ends better and the new year begins better by being far away from as much Zuck-tech as possible, I promise.</p>
