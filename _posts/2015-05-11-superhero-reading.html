<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/superheroes-mooc-the-reading-list">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p><em>This is the reading list for an edX MOOC I've signed up for, &ldquo;PopX1.1: Rise of the Superheroes.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not a required reading list, but it sets an interesting tone, I think, for what the instructor/the course values (in terms of superheroes, writers, illustrators).</em></p>
