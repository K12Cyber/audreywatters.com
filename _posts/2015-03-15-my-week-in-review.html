<h3>Travel</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Nope. Yesterday was one of the annual cringeworthy days for Hermosa Beach livin': the annual St. Patrick&#8217;s Day Parade. I&#8217;m a little worried how hot it is in Los Angeles already. But hey. Sunshine. I can put up with one or two days of drunkenness in the streets, as long as the water supply holds up. (<a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-famiglietti-drought-california-20150313-story.html">Gulp</a>.)</li>
