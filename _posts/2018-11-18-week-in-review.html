<li>I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of organizational work on the book this week &#8211; adding all the notes and photos from my trip to ETS to Scrivener, making sure all the books and articles I&#8217;ve read (or that I plan to read) are in Zotero</li>

Thanks to everyone who helped track down these articles &#8211; there are many more articles that I need to find, so I am going to try to take a day-trip to a nearby university library in the coming weeks so that I can get everything</li>

<ul>
<li>This time of year I&#8217;m usually well into writing my year-in-review articles. But this year, I&#8217;m too busy with the book to devote two months to that project. As of now, I&#8217;m planning to do a much shorter version of the series</li>
<li>I talked to Nathan Maton in preparation for a recording we&#8217;ll do in a week or so about tech ethics</li>
<li>I talked to Navneet Alang about an article he&#8217;s working on on learning analytics</li>
</ul>
