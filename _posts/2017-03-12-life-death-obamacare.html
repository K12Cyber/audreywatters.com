<p>When the Republicans in Congress introduced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/affordable-care-act-obamacare-health.html">their replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act</a>, I felt like I&#8217;d been kicked in the stomach. Kicked in the stomach by their callousness. Kicked in the stomach by the grief and trauma of remembering life (and death) before Obamacare.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/839221200576401408">I took to Twitter to tell my story</a> &#8211; or at least what could fit into 20 tweets of 140 characters or less. There&#8217;s much more to tell here. I didn&#8217;t mention that my husband was only 33 when he was diagnosed with cancer, for example. That I was 34 when I was widowed. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like to talk much about this part of my life. It&#8217;s too painful to revisit, even though I am aware that both my son and I carry that pain with us all the time. But I wanted to tell this story publicly because the Republicans want to dismantle what&#8217;s already a pretty flawed health care system in this country just so they can give tax breaks to the richest Americans.</p>

<p>That is shameful. </p>

<p>People will suffer. People will die.</p>
