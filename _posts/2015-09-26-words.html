<p><em><a href="http://www.aud.life/2015/500-words">This post first appeared on aud.life</a></em></p>

<p>I was supposed to finish <em>Teaching Machines</em> this summer. That didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>Instead of a summer of (book, idea) creation, I had a summer of great loss.</p>
<p>I was supposed to finish <em>Teaching Machines</em> in September. That didn&rsquo;t happen either.</p>
<p>I had forgotten, I suppose, how debilitating grief can be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve (almost) finished off two of the other writing projects that have lingered on because of summer crises. They&rsquo;re in editors&rsquo; hands now. Completing those was difficult, much more difficult than it should have been.</p>
<p>Any writing right now feels painful. The words just don&rsquo;t want to come. The thoughts just don&rsquo;t want to form.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ease back into writing by doing the following: writing 500 words a day (give or take) here on this site. I&rsquo;m writing here and not on audreywatters.com and not on hackeducation.com because this place, I feel, can be a rougher sketchpad for my ideas. Hopefully things I jot down here can be fleshed out into actual essays and talks and articles and book chapters. Hopefully things I jot down here will be worth hitting the "share" button. But there&rsquo;s no pressure to do any of that.</p>
<p>For now I&rsquo;ve just got to get back into the practice of thinking and making sentences.</p>
