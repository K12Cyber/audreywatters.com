<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I had a nice chat with Scott McLeod about robots and teachers.</li>
<li>So far so good with the Superheroes MOOC. (I&#8217;ve watched the videos <em>and</em> done the homework.)</li>
<li>I penned an EML article for Monday.</li>
<li>EML founders Will Richardson and Bruce Dixon announced this week that Educating Modern Learners will be winding down publication. I haven&#8217;t been editing the publication this year, but I have been writing regularly. Time to find more freelance work, I guess. Or remind folks that there are many ways already to <a href="http://hackeducation.com/support/">support my work</a>.</li>
<li>I submitted some edits for my book review of Liz Losh&#8217;s <em>War on Learning</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reading and Viewing</h3>
<br />
<ul>
<li>I watched <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> with the kid. (Review to come)</li>
<li>I watched the season finale of <em>The Simpsons</em>. (It dealt with ed-tech. <a href="https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/600398328849793024">I even made an animated GIF</a>.)</li>
<li>I started reading Bruce Schneier&#8217;s <em>Data and Goliath</em>.</li>
<li>I read Cory Doctorow&#8217;s <em>Homeland</em>.</li>
