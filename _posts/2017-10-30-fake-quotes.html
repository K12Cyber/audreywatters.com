<p>I love the old Guy Debord saying &#8220;Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it.&#8221; Of course, Debord stole the quotation from Comte de Lautréamont&#8217;s <em>Poésies II</em>: &#8220;Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It holds tight an author&#8217;s phrase, uses his expressions, eliminates a false idea, and replaces it with just the right idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Debord, the appropriation of Lautréamont was an expression of his idea of <em>détournement</em>, a radical act of defamiliarization that could shake up staid sensibilities. And I very much like the idea of appropriating and twisting familiar quotations. I&#8217;m fond, for example, of pointing to Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s famous proclamation about education technology: &#8220;The arc of ed-tech is long, but it bends towards the LMS.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I strongly dislike the sharing of misattributed quotations when the purpose isn&#8217;t subversion or provocation &#8211; when it&#8217;s just a matter of shoddy research and the lazy insertion of a familiar quotation hoping that it will do the intellectual and political work for you. </p>

<p>I saw this happen today in an op-ed in Edsurge &#8211; an invocation of something that John Dewey most certainly did not say: &#8220;If we teach today&#8217;s students as we taught yesterday&#8217;s, we rob them of tomorrow.&#8221; And there are a bunch of these sayings that you&#8217;ll see all the time in education circles &#8211; on Twitter, in slide decks. &#8220;If you judge a fish by its ability to climb tree, it will go its whole life believing it is stupid&#8221; &#8211; misattributed to Einstein. Also misattributed to Einstein: &#8220;education is what remains after you&#8217;ve forgotten everything you learned in school.&#8221; Or this one that Mark Twain supposedly said: &#8220;I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.&#8221; Or this one attributed incorrectly to Ben Franklin: &#8220;Tell me and I forget, teach me and I remember, involve me and I learn.&#8221; Or this one that folks give Alvin Toffler credit for: &#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s illiterate will not be the man who can&#8217;t read; he will be the man who has not learned how to learn.&#8221; If you actually read <em>Future Shock</em>, you&#8217;d see Toffler cites his source. He&#8217;s actually quoting Herbert Gerjuoy.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s behind all these wrong quotations? Is it something about the compulsion to be pithy on social media? Is it something about the expectations of PowerPoint &#8211; you need to include an inspirational sentence from a famous white guy laid over a majestic nature scene? Does this reflect our current information environment, where we fail to fact-check and prefer to go with our gut? &#8220;This feels like something Abraham Lincoln would say.&#8221;</p>
