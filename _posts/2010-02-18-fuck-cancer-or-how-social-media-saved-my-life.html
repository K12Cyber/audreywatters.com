<p>I keep a running list of topics I&#8217;d like to blog about here: social gaming, mashups as <em>détournement</em>, all manner of geeky, techie, academic stuff. On that list is the topic of social media and cancer, a topic much more difficult to write about than any densely theoretical or technical essay.</p>

<p>I began blogging four years ago when my husband was diagnosed with liver cancer. I didn&#8217;t actually intend to start blogging regularly. I was an active participant on some Reality TV forums (don&#8217;t judge!) and as I struggled to deal with his diagnosis, with our finances, with politics, I wrote a little rant that seemed deserving of a far wider audience than the couple of hundred folks who checked in regularly to deconstruct Survivor and to smack-talk American Idol contestants.</p>
