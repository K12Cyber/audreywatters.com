<p>I try to make a note of when I am &#8220;in the news,&#8221; linking to media mentions of me, my work. But I don&#8217;t often write about when I am &#8220;on the syllabus,&#8221; which is probably something I enjoy even more. </p>

<p>I learned about my work being assigned and wrestled with in a couple of classes last week, and I appeared in some assignments: one formal and one informal.</p>

<p>On the informal end, &#8220;Audrey Watters quotations as de-motivational posters&#8221; seemed to be a brief thing on Twitter:</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry I am late to the party, but it took me a while to match the perfect quote with the perfect image :) <a href="https://t.co/g2xc6HL470">pic.twitter.com/g2xc6HL470</a></p>&mdash; Jim Groom (@jimgroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimgroom/status/1041615723200688130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2018</a></blockquote>

<p>More formally, one of George Veletsianos&#8217; students used my work in an &#8220;<a href="https://malat-webspace.royalroads.ca/rru0058/epic-rap-battle-of-educational-technology-history/">epic rap battle</a>,&#8221; and frankly it is so amazing that I just might retire.</p>
