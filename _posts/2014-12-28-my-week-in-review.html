<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<br />
<p>My major undertaking this week: a redesign of all my websites. I moved from a home-spun CMS to Jekyll. (The new theme: <a href="https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator">Mediator</a>.) All my sites are now powered by Github Pages. No database to manage! (No database to ask Kin to help me manage!) This has allowed me to shut down my AWS server.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still working on getting the sites to work and look perfectly. One problem I&#8217;ve found: Feedburner. I&#8217;ve wondered for the last year or so if and when Google was going to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/28/the-feedburner-deathwatch-continues-google-kills-adsense-for-feeds/">close Feedburner</a> (particularly after it killed its AdSense for feeds service). On the redesigned sites, I link to the original feeds, not the Feedburner version. And I think I&#8217;ve redirected Feedburner subscribers back to the original feed too. We&#8217;ll see if it works. (Update your subscriptions: <a href="http://audreywatters.com/feed.xml">http://audreywatters.com/feed.xml</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/feed.xml">http://hackeducation.com/feed.xml</a>.)</p>

<p>Because of my issues with RSS this week, I&#8217;ve decided to ditch Reeder, the application I was using to read feeds on my Mac. I use Feedbin to manage my feeds, and for now I&#8217;m quite happy simply using its Web interface to read feeds.</p>

<p>I enrolled audreywatters.com and hackeducation.com in Cloudflare.</p>

<p>Nancy Flanagan said <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/teachers/teacher_in_a_strange_land/2014/12/best_and_worst_ed-books_of_2014_an_oddball_list.html">nice things</a> about The Monsters of Education Technology in her Ed Week column.</p>

<h3>Family and Friends</h3>
<br />
<p>The kid flew home on Christmas Day. </p>

<p>Kin and I hung out with Gary Stager and Sylvia Martinez on Boxing Day.</p>
