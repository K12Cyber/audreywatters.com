<h2>(No) Travel</h2>
<p>Another week at home in Hermosa Beach. Damn, I love it here, even when the beach is full of partying volleyball players (See above).</p>

<h2>Hack Education Writing</h2>

<h2>Reading &amp; Viewing</h2>
<p>I did a lot of reading this week, finishing Katherine Hayles&rsquo; <em>How We Became Posthuman</em>, BF Skinner&rsquo;s <em>Walden Two</em>, and Daniel H. Wilson&rsquo;s <em>Robopocalypse</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to watching a lot of football, I watched <em>Snowpiercer</em>. Highly recommended. The film that is. Not football. Maybe now that the World Cup is over, I can return to a higher level of productivity. (87 days &rsquo;til hockey season starts.)</p>
<h2>In the Media</h2>
<p>I was cited in an article in <em>The Baffler</em>, "<a href="http://www.thebaffler.com/blog/2014/07/the_digital_native_a_profitable_myth">The 'Digital Native,' a Profitable Myth</a>" and in a write-up about a panel I was on earlier this year on &rdquo;<a href="http://www.oclc.org/publications/nextspace/articles/issue23/thehopeandhypeofmoocs.en.html">The Hype and Hope of MOOCs</a>."</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>I did a fair amount of &ldquo;Reclaim Your Domain&rdquo; work this week: I deleted my Facebook account, and <a href="http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2014/06/15/ditch-gmail/">thanks to this great set of instructions from Doug Belshaw</a> on ditching Gmail, am starting the process of extracting myself from Google&rsquo;s tentacles. No more using Chrome. No more using Google as primary search. (Quitting Facebook is much much easier.) I&rsquo;ve got a new email address now, which the infographic-spammers took no time in locating.</p>
<p>I also set up a <a href="http://is.gd/pgp_aw">PGP Key</a>.</p>
<p>I collected some resources for a &ldquo;learn to program&rdquo; project I need to find more time for: a guide for <a href="https://storify.com/audreywatters/byob-build-your-own-bot">How to Build a Twitter Bot</a>.</p>
<p>A couple of thousand words written in <em>Teaching Machines</em>. Ugh. I&rsquo;m just not as efficient as a robot-writer, am I.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Kin&rsquo;s daughter is still staying with us for another week, and we have his niece here too.</p>
<p>Bummed to hear of the death of Tommy Ramone, who was the last surviving member of The Ramones. Listening to a bunch of their music reminds me, of course, of Anthony&rsquo;s memorial service (where Ed and Cosmo played &ldquo;Beat on the Brat&rdquo; much to Anthony&rsquo;s parents shock.</p>
<p>Speaking of them, it doesn&rsquo;t sound like Anthony&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s health is at all good. My little brother just visited my dad, and his health seems fine. Dads. Yeah. Sigh. I think that's all I got to say about that today...</p>
