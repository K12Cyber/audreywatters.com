<p>I think you nailed it when you say that what counts as an "education record" and therefore protected by FERPA is really unclear. Here's the Department of Education's completely unhelpful definition:&nbsp; "The term 'education records' is defined as those records that contain information directly related to a student and which are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution." I think we recognize that this includes transcripts, grades, and so on. But does an education record include metadata about how frequently a student uses a piece of software? Does it include their IP address? <br /><br />Schools and their vendors are allowed to collect and share data if it has an "educational purpose" but WTF is that? With our current obsession with educational data, I can see people arguing that every click a student makes on a computer has an "educational purpose."<br /><br />FERPA purportedly prevents the disclosure of personally identifiable information without consent. Clicking "I agree" to the Terms of Service does count as consent, and I highly doubt students (or their professors) read what they've agreed to. Companies can also claim that the data they're collecting is not personally identifiable. Again, these definitions -- and how they're full of weasel words -- matter.</p>
