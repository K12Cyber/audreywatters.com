It was a nasty he-said-she-said train-wreck. "I have no patience for or interest in your marital drama spam in my news feed," I wrote on my Facebook wall... or something to that effect. (Of course, several friends in turn chastised me as they very much enjoyed the soap opera.) But as someone who tries to teach about Facebook privacy and cautions against leaving a digital footprint that's stepped in dogshit, well, it just seems ill-advised and as my Granny would say "poor form."<p></p>
But it's not always so easy to delineate between what's appropriate and what's inappropriate for a Facebook (or Twitter or blog) post. I'm always guilty of blending the personal and the professional in these social networking spaces, much to the chagrin of some people I work with who think there should be a lot more dignified head shots and a lot less pictures of my tattoos, a lot more marketing-messaging and a lot less tweets about awesome <em>Star Wars</em> fan culture. And even on this blog, which is <strong>my </strong>space but where I'm trying to establish the whole Audrey Watters brand thing, hell, I probably type "Fuck" way too much.<p></p>
Well, and then there's the Leo part of my personality, I guess, the part that wants to be the focus of attention and alongside the rabble-rouser in me, wants to make a big scene. If I'd have been able to afford it, I might have been someone in a pre-social media world who'd have hired a plane to write some a (knowing me, caustic) message in the sky. I guess it's best I just blog about that stuff nowadays, huh.<p></p>
I have a Big Announcement to make tomorrow. And so I'm up late tonight fretting over both the content and the form of my message. Handwritten? Face-to-face? Will I Facebook it? Will I tweet it? And dammit, why didn't I plan this far enough in advance to make a stop-motion-animated video of it? Or (OMG!) rent a skywriting plane?
