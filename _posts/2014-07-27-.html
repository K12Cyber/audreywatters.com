<h2>Teaching Machines</h2>
<p>It was a fairly decent week of writing, even though I spent a chunk of it talking about <em>Phaedrus</em>, as one does I suppose when writing about knowledge and technologies.</p>
<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>Hey, I made my first appearance in <a href="http://www.politico.com/morningeducation/0714/morningeducation14774.html">Politico&rsquo;s Morning EDU news</a> (sorta) &ndash; that&rsquo;s me, unnamed, calling some of the members of the Parent Coalition for Student Privacy &ldquo;bigots.&rdquo; I spent much of Thursday on the Twitters talking about this issue. Frankly, I'm appalled that people who describe themselves as "liberals" would align with groups that are anti-science, anti-immigration, anti-LGBTQ, anti-choice, anti-pension. How will groups that actively work against certain groups' civil rights protect student data and student privacy? Will they use this as an opportunity to deny access to information? I need to blog about this...</p>

<p>I bought tickets for our trip to the UK in September. (I&rsquo;m speaking at the <a href="https://www.alt.ac.uk/alt-conference/altc2014">ALT Conference</a>.) We&rsquo;ll be there from August 29 - September 9, and the plan is to visit Haslemere, Coventry, Newcastle, Bletchley Park, and Brighton (for IndieWebCamp UK). My mum is going to be there at the same time, so that&rsquo;ll make driving and visiting family easier.</p>
<p><strong>New tattoos</strong>! A little bit of Whitman on my left arm ("Resist much, obey little") and a little bit of Byron on my right ("Down with all kings but King Ludd").</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I started reading Liz Losh&rsquo;s <em>The War on Learning</em>, and I also re-read Plato&rsquo;s <em>Phaedrus</em>.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>Not much to report. The apartment seems quiet without the kids around. My dad turned 70 this week, and we had a really good chat on the phone. (We don&rsquo;t talk often.)</p>
