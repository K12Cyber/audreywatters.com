<p><em>I&rsquo;m working on an article as part of my Spencer Fellowship and part of the larger research I&rsquo;m undertaking this year (which involves tracking the networks of influence among technology investors and entrepreneurs interested in education, education technology, and education reform).</em></p>
<p><strong>Where did this &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; craze come from?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not asking who in Silicon Valley was &ldquo;first&rdquo; to teach students programming. Indeed, there&rsquo;s a much longer history of computing in education that many involved with this latest push for &ldquo;coding&rdquo; overlook: the work of those developing and teaching LOGO, for example.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious about a couple of stories here: the origin story of Codecademy, for starters &ndash; an idea the startup founders came up with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/18/codecademy-a-slick-fun-way-to-teach-yourself-how-to-program/">a week and a half before Demo Day</a> at Y Combinator in 2011. Y Combinator has now supported many, many &ldquo;learn to code&rdquo; startups. But when the founders of AppJet &ndash; who eventually focused on their Etherpad product, later acquired by Google &ndash; had a different experience at YC. Back in 2008 or so, they were discouraged from building a programming tutorial. What changed (at YC and beyond) and why?</p>
<p>Codecademy is a particularly interesting startup here because it garnered so much positive press (with a few notable exceptions cough) and so much high profile hype. Remember Code Year &ndash; even then Mayor Bloomberg tweeted that his new year&rsquo;s resolution was to learn to code. Codecademy sort of faded from view &ndash; there are only so many exciting stories you can write about a Web-based IDE, I suppose. But other startups and organizations maintained the &ldquo;learn-to-code&rdquo; drumbeat, particularly Code.org.</p>
<p>What motivated the founding of Code.org in 2013? It came after &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">the Year of the MOOC</a>&rdquo; in 2012, which was very much a story about higher education&rsquo;s failure to focus on high tech skills training. (Sebastian Thrun, for example, would often claim &ndash; incorrectly &ndash; that colleges do not teach things like mobile app development.)</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s funding this narrative that everyone needs to learn to code? (I&rsquo;ve started tracking some of this as part of my larger researcher into venture capital&rsquo;s influence in education technology and education policy. Here&rsquo;s what Code.org&rsquo;s funding network looks like: <a href="https://hack-education-data.github.io/code-dot-org/">hack-education-data.github.io/code-dot-org</a>.)</p>
