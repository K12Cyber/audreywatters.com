<p>I&#8217;ve given all my websites a face lift over the holidays. It was time for a new &#8220;look&#8221; as I&#8217;d been tweaking the same WordPress theme for over 4 years.</p>

<p>The biggest change to my sites is actually under the hood, as I&#8217;ve moved from my old content management system to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which I&#8217;ve been using to <a href="http://audreywatters.com/2013/07/07/how-to-run-your-site-on-github/">run some of my Web projects</a> &#8211; but not my blogs &#8211; for the past year and a half.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve really enjoyed using GitHub Pages to power these projects, in no small part because I can add new sections to my site without having to ask for the IT Department&#8217;s help. (That is, Kin&#8217;s.) The big thing for me: I don&#8217;t have to worry about setting up a database, something that&#8217;s always been a big obstacle hindering me fully managing my content via a traditional CMS.</p>

<p>As I have added more projects to my sites, I&#8217;ve come to realize that the traditional notion of &#8220;blog&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really meet my needs any longer. Rather, I&#8217;m not sure that presenting all my writing in reverse-chronological order makes much sense. I&#8217;ve got several different kinds of writing &#8211; my weekly news roundups, my essays, the transcripts from my talks, my books. I want to be able to highlight each of these and not have them buried under several pages of blog posts. I&#8217;m still working on the best way to do this, but I feel like the redesign, which uses the <a href="https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator">Mediator theme</a>, is a solid step in that direction.</p>

<p>There are likely to be some bugs and some broken links. You can send me an email, give me a shout on Twitter, or heck, <a href="https://github.com/audreywatters/audreywatters.com">file an issue on GitHub</a> in order to let me know.</p>
